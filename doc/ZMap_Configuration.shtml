Column Ordering
---------------

There are two column orderings required for zmap, the columns in the main zmap window and the
column orderings in the navigator window. These are specified in the ZMap configuration file in
the "source" stanza:


source
{
featuresets = "Locus \"3 Frame\" \"3 Frame Translation\" vertebrate_mRNA Assembly_Tags etc."
navigator = "Genomic_canonical Locus Scale"
}

(Note that feature set names can have embedded blanks)

These lists not only specify the order of columns but also control which feature sets will be
displayed, if the feature set (or its Column_group) is not in this list then the feature will not
be displayed.


Other Column settings
---------------------

acedb did not allow configuration of attributes such as "between column" spacing, we could
add this to the acedb database in the form of some kind of "meta style" but probably its
better to simply specify this in the configuration file.

Currently we have:

"canvas_maxsize"              maximum size in pixels of canvas window
"canvas_maxbases"             <not used>
"keep_empty_columns"          maintain empty columns to keep even spacing on screen between blocks
"display_forward_coords"      when specified means coords for reverse complement view are -ve of forward coords
"show_3_frame_reverse"        when specified means 3 frame cols are displayed on reverse strand as well

spacing:

"align_spacing"               these all control the horizontal space between various parts of zmap,
"block_spacing"               probably column spacing is the most relevant.
"strand_spacing"
"column_spacing"
"feature_spacing"

"feature_line_width"          controls default thickness of lines used for feature display.
