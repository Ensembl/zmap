<h2>Running ZMap on the Mac</h2>

<fieldset><legend>From another PC</legend>
<p>
This is tricky as with the normal SSH route you have to set ip $DISPLAY to some magic value and the Mac refuses access to X.

<fieldset><legend>On the ZMap Team's Mac</legend>
<p>
This is Gemma's PC (mac18480i) and if you log in you still have the same probelms with X.
</p>
<p>
Get Gemma to run ZMap and supply your own config:
<pre>
/nfs/users/nfs_m/mh17/zmap/ZMap/src/build/macosx/zmap --conf_dir=/nfs/users/nfs_m/mh17/.ZMap
</pre>
You also have to give Gemma write permission on the directory and remove any existing zmap.log.
Put the permissions back afterwards.

<fieldset><legend>Using commands</legend>
<p>
Most unix commands appear to exist, but 'ls' does not work very well, you have to use 'echo *' instead.
