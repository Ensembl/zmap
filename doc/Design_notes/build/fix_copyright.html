<h2>Writing the Right Copyright dates? Right</h2>

<fieldset<legend>Ed says:</legend>
<p>
There is no way in cvs (or in svn either) to get just the year substituted in so it looks like some perl....
</p>

<p>
We need to change the copyright line which is at the top of each of our source code files, currently it reads:
<pre>
 *  Copyright (c) XXXX: Genome Research Ltd.
</pre>
where XXXX is a number of different dates.
</p>

<p>
It should all be changed to read:
<pre>
 *  Copyright (c) 2006 - 2010 Genome Research Ltd.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Be good to report any .c or .h files that don't have a copyright line.
</p>

</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend>How to do this?</legend>
<p>We can use find to pull out all the .c an .h files so that we can process then one by one.
</p>
<p>A script can process each file by:
<ul>
  <li>getting edit permission from CVS
  <li>filtering the file via a perl script
  <li>committing the file to CVS if successful
</ul>
</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be simplest to write a shell script to operate the CVS, but surely perl can run commands?</p>
</fieldset>
<fieldset><legend>Where and How?</legend>
<p>The script will live in the ZMap/scripts directory, as this is for build related functions, and be called 'CopyRight'. </p>
<p>In the interests of a quite life it is recommended that all files should be returned to CVS and ZMap should acheive a clean build before starting.</p>
