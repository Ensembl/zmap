<h2>Highlighting relevant evidence in ZMap</h2>
<fieldset><legend>Introduction</legend>
<p>A number of requests for features have been received and may involve significant interaction between Otterlace and Zmap.  Those requested following the recent annotation test (2009/10) are collated here.
</p>
<p>
A common theme is the selection of features from a (marked) region and displaying or highlighting relevant ones according to variable criteria. The intention is to perform the necessary analysis in Otterlace as with a scripting interface more rapid development is possible.
Similar functions may already exist in ZMap (eg colinear lines and homology markers on bumped alignments). Some of these could possibly be implemented in ZMap and this point is open to discussion.
</p>
<h3>Interface to Otterlace</h3>
<p>Some notes are available <a href="Design_notes/notes/otter_zmap.shtml#otterface">below</a>.
</p>

</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend>RT 69060 - Hide EST's that are covered by mRNA data</legend>
<p>Some notes about how to do this in ZMap without interaction with otterlace can be found <a href="Design_notes/notes/EST_mRNA.shtml">here</a>.
There is also the option of otterlace providing separate featuresets for masked and unmasked data, which would be a very neat solution.
</p>
Close reading of the ticket suggests that this is not intended to be an interactive process and simply applies to whole columns, in which case the interactive process below may not be relevant.
</p>
<p>Although not mentioned in the RT ticket there are plans for this to be driven by a button or menu option. An annotator will be working on a marked region (or an implied marked region related to a selected feature?) and will want to see related non-duplicated evidence.  For example given an mRNA there may be hundreds of EST features covering the same region and many of these may tell nothing new - the EST's may correspond exactly to some of the mRNA data.
</p>
<p>On selecting the feature/region, and the function (for example by a right click menu in ZMap or by a menu option in the otterlace Tools menu) otterlace will request or Zmap will send information about the features present in the relevant columns in the given range.  As ZMap has no way to know which columns/ featuresets are relevant (and hard coding this is a poor choice - the names can change) it makes sense for Otterlace to specify the featuresets (these could be specified in styles) and range.  Protocol already exists for otterlace to know the selected feature or marked region.  If necessary, ZMap can send a request to trigger the whole process.
</p>
<p>The end result of this process would be a list of features to display within the marked region - effectively like bumping a column (or several) but with only the relevant features displayed.
</p>
<h4>Sequence of events</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> user selects an mRNA or marks a region
<li> a) user selects the RC menu in ZMap - ZMap sends otterlace the region or feature and requests EST masking
<li> b) user selects Tools/EST masking in otterlace and otterlace requests the region or feature (ZMap replies with the data)
<li> otterlace requests EST features in the given range and specified columns
<li> otterlace calculates which ones to mask and sends a list of EST features to remove from the display or a list of which ones to display
<li> zmap automatically bumps the relevant columns and displays only the specified features
</ul>
</p>
<p>This process does look complicated: is there any benefit in implementing this instead of <a href="Design_notes/notes/EST_mRNA.shtml">having ZMap calculate it</a>?
</p>

<fieldset><legend>RT 69003 - Automating Dotter</legend>
<p>
For a series of EST's we wish to have an automated process to see if each of them is represented by any of a series of existing annotated transcripts.  As the number of combinations can be quite large it is not practical to do this by hand.  The original ticket mentions 'check to see of the dotter is an uninterrupted diagonal line', but the reality is that approximate matches are needed and that in most cases there will be that diagonal line but it will fade out and not be full length, or there will be breaks near the tail - it is necessary for the annotator to see the dotter output and interpret it.
</p>
<p>Initially individual transcripts will be compared with multiple EST's - this is already implemented in dotter.
</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>To provide a clean interface for selecting features and presenting results the following is suggested:
<ul>
<li> the user selects 'Compare ESTs and Transcripts' from the window RC menu
<li> a popup is displayed with panes for lists of EST and transcript features
<li> the user shift-selects EST and transcript features and clicking on a 'Load' button puts the selected features in the relevant lists. (Repeat till satisfied). This uses existing multiple feature selection (focus) functions which are restricted to one column at a time.
<li> transcripts can be selected in this window
<li> the user clicks on a 'Dotter' button and the ESTs and transcripts are processed.
<li> clicking on any feature will highlight it in ZMap
<li> features can be removed from the lists at any time.
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Further developments</h4>
<p>The above initial solution will be trialed for feedback.  Some idea for improving it have been suggested:
<ul>
<li> modify Dotter to provide a grid of results rather than a column and show all combinations at once
<li> modify dotter to overlay multiple alignments using different colours. Clicking on a colour will select that EST
<li> create an option for one EST to be aligned with many transcripts. To avoid confusion modify Dotter to produce a horizontal output (row not column).
</ul>
</p>

<fieldset><legend>RT 111154 - Highlighting features sharing the same splice sites</legend>
<p>As in 'Apollo' - given a selected transcript light up homologies that match.
</p>
<p>Given a transcript we can define the splice sites unambiguously via intron/exon boundaries in which case any analysis is clear cut.  If we can select a transcript, and then RC on a (bumped) alignment column to select a menu item then we also have a simple user interface.
</p>
<p>This is an obvious candidate for a new sub-feature glyph type where we can emulate the Apollo display.
</p>

<a name="evidence"></a>
<fieldset><legend>RT 24526, 156650 - Highlighting evidence or transcripts</legend>
<p><ul>
<li> User selects evidence, related transcript is highlit.
<li> User selects transcript, related evidence is highlit.
</ul>
This clearly needs a list of features to highlight from otterlace.  Grey has been mentioned as the highlight colour, the idea being to divert the annotator's attention towards data not yet used.
</p>
<p>Evidence and transcript will both be highlit.  As evidence can appear in several columns a single colour defined in the window will be used - this will identify all the evidence as one group. Defining different (contrasting) colours per style could be confusing for the user.
</p>

<h4>Sequence of events</h4>
<ul>
<li> user selects feature
<li> user selects RC menu and chooses show transcript or show evidence
<li> Zmap requests related features from otterlace
<li> otterlace replies and ZMap highlights them
</ul>
<h4>Highlighting the features</h4>
<p>ZMap styles provide normal and selected colours. To show related features such as evidence already used it has been suggested that these features 'go grey' which requires another colour spec or style.
<b>zmapWindowFocus.c</b> mentions <b>window->colour_item_highlight</b> which is used for items that have no select colour defined and further colours can be defined in the window for 'used as evidence' features. Currently highlighting with window colours only affects the fill colour.
</p>
<p>
As we are now dealing with two independant sets of highlit features (evidence and focus) we need to define how they interact.  Focus is at the top level and should always be visible. It is displayed by changing the fill colour, and the focus column is always shown. If we set the evidence colours to affect border and fill then it will be possible to see both at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Window colours are set in <b>zmapWindowDrawFeatures.c/setColours()</b>.
</p>
<p>The WindowFocus code will be modified to handle multiple lists of related features; see <a href="Design_notes/notes/focus_list.shtml">here</a>.
</p>

<h4>Clearing evidence/transcript highlights</h4>
<p>There is some value in having related features highlit semi-permanently.
When do they get un-highlit? a) if another feature is used to request related data b) via the RC menu/'hide related features'. If a feature is selected (becomes the focus) and then used to select evidence related features and then loses focus the evidence is still highlit. We need to provide two menu options 1) to show evidence and 2) hide evidence, and 1) will also hide any evidence already highlit.
</p>
<p> But it's a little more complicated. Requesting related features is a feature specific function and appears on the feature menu. Hide features must appear if some are highlit but cannot be in the feature menu as the option will not appear if there is no focus feature. The feature menu can offer 'highlight evidence' or 'highlight transcript' depending on the focus feature type. The column menu can offer 'hide xxxx' depending on the type highlit, but to avoid confusion (as hide implies removal from display) this will be expressed as a toggle item with a tick and be called 'highlight XXX', and by selecting this menu item the user is unticking the box.

<h3>XML interface</h3>
<p>
Here's some sample requests from ZMap. <i>These are are an early stage of specification and suggested improvements/ corrections are welcomed.</i>
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: the XML protocol is to be changed soon to simplify it and provide a single window interface and to allow responses to be matched to requests.  Currently they are assumed to be in order and not missing!  The following examples show the message content that will be include in the improved protocol.
</p>

<h4>ZMap requests features to highlight</h4>
<pre>
&lt;zmap&gt;
  &lt;request action="evidence_features"&gt;
    &lt;align name="chr4-04_210623-364887_master"&gt;
      &lt;block name="1.0.+_1.0.+"&gt;
        &lt;featureset&gt;
          &lt;feature name="Z95704.2-001" strand="-" style="havana_tsct" start="53842" end="88488"&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="53842" end="55797" ontology="exon"/&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="78605" end="78700" ontology="exon"/&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="79196" end="79322" ontology="exon"/&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="88475" end="88488" ontology="exon"/&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="55798" end="78604" ontology="intron"/&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="78701" end="79195" ontology="intron"/&gt;
            &lt;subfeature start="79323" end="88474" ontology="intron"/&gt;
          &lt;/feature&gt;
        &lt;/featureset&gt;
      &lt;/block&gt;
    &lt;/align&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;
&lt;/zmap&gt;
</pre>
<pre>
(get transcript from evidence feature)
</pre>

<h4>Otterlace replies with lists of features</h4>
Both requests could be responded to by similar messages using unique action codes eg 'evidence_from_transcript' and 'transcript_from_evidence'.

<pre>
&lt;zmap&gt;
  &lt;response handled="true"&gt;
    &lt;align name="chr4-04_210623-364887_master"&gt;
      &lt;block name="1.0.+_1.0.+"&gt;
        &lt;featureset name="ens_cdna"&gt;
          &lt;feature name="Em:NM_001137608.1" strand="-" style="ens_cdna" start="88475" end="88488"/&gt;
        &lt;/featureset name-"EST_Human"&gt;
       &lt;featureset&gt;
          &lt;feature name="Em:DC397567.1" strand="-" style="est_align" start="55459" end="55797"/&gt;
        &lt;/featureset&gt;
      &lt;/block&gt;
   .&lt;/align&gt;
 &lt;/response&gt;
&lt;/zmap&gt;
</pre>

</p>
</fieldset>


<a name="otterface"></a>
<fieldset><legend>Interface to Otterlace</legend>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>There is a need for ZMap to operate on it s own and some advanced features can be implemented in several ways.  If Otterlace is connected then we wish to have the option of alternate behaviour and a mechanism for this exists in the current 'Feature Show' requests.
</p>
<p>ZMap will make requests to Otterlace informing Otterlace what it is about to do and Otterlace will respond this a message like the following:
<pre>
&lt;response handled="false"&gt;&lt;/response<&gt;

&lt;response handled="true"&gt; ... extra data ... &lt;/response&gt;
</pre>
In the first example ZMap will use default values and implement the fucntiobn itself; in the second ZMap will overwrite its default values with data given by otterlace and process any requests or commands included.
</p>
<p>Otterlace will have to choice of replying with a request for ZMap to do nothing and later follow up with a request to parform various actions.  This may be important if we wish to perform some extensive analysis of data in ZMap by default (eg masking ESTs by mRNAs) - it allows a quick decision to be made without having to wait for data.
</p>

<h3>Requests/ Commands needed</h3>
<p>NB: All the following is subject to implementation - user requirements and time available.
</p>
<p>As most of the data will no longer be stored in ACEDB it becomes necessary for ZMap to provide Otterlace with information about what features are present and this will include:
<ul>
<li> what features are present in a range and featureset
<li> what features are present in a range and column
<li> what is highlighted
<li> what is hidden
<li> what is visible
<li> column bump state
</ul>
</p>
<p>Actions that Otterlace can request from ZMap will include:
<ul>
<li> un/highlight specified features or sub-features
<li> hide/show features
<li> un/bump colum
<li> scroll to feature
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Featuresets and Columns</h4>
<p>There is possible confusion over the use of the words Featureset and Column. To avoid ambiguity we shall state the following:
<ul>
<li> A Featureset is a collection of features all of the same type and all from the same source. For technical/ historical reasons the name of the featureset and source are not necessarily the same but in most cases they are.
<li> A Column is an area on the ZMap display where one or more featuresets can be displayed.
<li> A featureset can contain data from both strands and several frames. Depending on configuration and use it is possible for all these features to be displayed in in column or several.
</ul>
</p>
<h5>An example</h5>
<p>The Column 'Repeats' is typically used to display the featuresets 'Repeatmasker_LINE' and 'Repeatmasker_SINE'.  Usually all these features are displayed in one column (not strand sensitive).
