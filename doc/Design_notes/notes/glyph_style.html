<p>
As of April 2010 glyphs will be changed, the main differences being:
<ul>

<li>mode specific config options (eg 'alignment-incomplete-glyph') will be
removed and replaced with generic commands that can be used in different style
modes. 'glyph' can be used to specify the shape to be drawn, and it will be possible to specify different shapes for 5' and 3' ends

<li>glyphs will not be presented as sub-styles but as styles in thier own right and these can be referenced via a 'sub-features' option on a non glyph-mode style.

<li>variable sized glyphs driven by the style's glyph-score-mode

<li>alternate colour driven by a score threshold

<li> glyphs can use the main style config options such as 3-frane colours and score mode.

</ul>
</p>
<p>Compatability with previous versions of ACEDB/ Otterlace will be maintained.</p>

<p>
Here's a summary of glyph configuration by way of examples.
</p>
<h3>Some relevant commands</h3>
NB: you may still need to set the column width via the style (esp for 3-Frame splice markers).
<pre>

[my-other-style]
mode=alignment                # here glyphs are sub-features
                              # and the styles to use are specified here:
sub-features = homology:red-triangles; splice: blue-diamond ;polyA: polyA-tail

[my-glyph-style]              # can be for feature type glyph or sub-feature
glyph = shape                 # shape to draw (both ends)
glyph-3 = shape               # shape to draw (bottom end)
glyph-5 = shape               # shape to draw (top end)

glyph-score-mode = width height size # change size according to score

glyph-score-mode = alt        # change colour according to threshold
glyph-threshold = X

glyph-strand = flip-x flip-y  # invert if on reverse strand

glyph-align = left right      # (defaults to centre if not specified)
                              # style width must be set
                              # see 'Aligning Glyphs' below for some useful comments

glyph-colours = pink          # for sub feature glyphs
glyph-alt-colours = turquoise
</pre>

<h3>3-Frame splice site markers</h3>
<pre>
[3-frame-splice]
mode = glyph

width=30.0                    # make enough space for left and right pointing hooks
frame-mode=only-1             # is frame specific so will use the colours, display in 1 column
strand-specific=true
show-reverse-strand=false     # NB there are no rev strand features
show_when_empty=false

score-mode=width
min-score= -2.0               # as in previous ACEDB style
max-score = 4.0
glyph-5 = up-hook
glyph-3 = dn-hook

colours = normal fill grey    # for central vertical line if we draw it
frame0-colours = normal fill red; normal border red
frame1-colours = normal fill green; normal border green
frame2-colours = normal fill blue; normal border blue

bump-mode=unbump
</pre>
<h4> Handling 3F-splice markers</h4>
<p>These are a little non standard.  The data is for the forwards strand only and the min and max scores can be set in the GeneFinder application and typically are -2.0 to +4.0.  These scores are the log probability of there being a splice site, so -ve values (hooks on the left) are less likely than random.
</p>
<p>If the score for a glyph is -ve then the width factor calculated will also be -ve and this will cause the glyph to be reflected in the origin, which itself will be calculated off centre in the column as min and max are not symetrical.
</p>
<p>Note that 3-Frame splice markers are generated by the GeneFinder program and currently require ACEDB to be running. They are also explicitly only for the forward strand (meaningless with reverse complemented data) and the style above is designed to hide them when reverse complemented.
</p>
<p>Note also that the 5' and 3' feature attributes from GeneFinder are Intron-centric and therefore are the opposite sense to that normally used in ZMap.
</p>

<p>The style as defined above is what gets used if you specify in [ZMap] 'legacy_styles = true', and the glyphs are defined as:
<pre>
[glyphs]
dn-hook = <0,0; 15,0; 15,10>
up-hook = <0,0; 15,0; 15,-10>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>incomplete homology markers </h3>
<pre>
[homology-marker]
mode = glyph

glyph-5 = up-tri
glyph-3 = dn-tri
glyph-score-mode = alt
glyph-threshold = 5
glyph-colour = normal fill red       # for &gt;= threshold
glyph-alt-colour = mormal fill green # for &lt; threshold
</pre>


<h3>non-consensus splice site</h3>
<pre>
[nc-splice]
mode = glyph

glyph = diamond
glyph-colours = blue
</pre>

<h3>Truncated transcript</h3>

<pre>
mode = glyph
(TBD)
glyph-5 = up-dotted-line
glyph-3 = dn-dotted-line
glyph-colours = blue
</pre>

<p>This could be coded as a separate featureset in the transcripts column.</p>

</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend>Defining glyph shapes</legend>

<h3>Attempting Clarity</h3>

<p>In order to make styles files readable by humans glyph shapes will be
defined by names, which will refer to a config stanza in the ZMap main config
file. This will be called <b>[glyphs]</b> and will consist of a single line
per glyph of the form 'name=drawing-spec'. </p>

<h3>Specifying Glyph shapes</h3>

<p>As we draw glyphs using GDK operations we will define shapes in a way
compatible with these, and this means we can specify lines, simple polygons
and ellipses. We assume that only one filled polygon is to be specified per
glyph in the interests of display speed. However, experiments with GDK show that
we can cross lines to generate more complex shapes such as bow-ties. </p>

<p>Glyphs are defined via coordinates relative to an origin (0,0) specified in
pixels. The origin is where the shape is anchored to the feature, and the
feature's anchor point will be in the centre of its column at its Y-coordinate
- it will be possible to define shapes offset from the centre. Points are
defined as (signed) coordinate pairs separated by semi-colons. </p>

<p>As the GDK drawing primitives draw filled shapes with border and fill
colours if we attempt to combine these into one glyph we would end up with
internal lines and opt not to allow this. (for example a square and a triangle
combined) </p>

<pre>
    _____
   |     |\
   |     | \
   |     | /
   |_____|/

</pre>

<h4>Drawing line based glyphs</h4>

<p>We use angle brackets to enclose the glyph description.</p>

<p>A list of points is given and by default lines between consecutive points
are implied. Adding a '/' between points will signify a break. </p>

<p>If the list of points is unbroken and the first and last points are
identical then the stanza defines a polygon and the shape will be filled with
the fill colour specified in the style. There is a hard coded limit of 16 points
per shape and line breaks are included in this.</p>

<pre>
[glyphs]
up-triangle=&lt;0,-4; 4,0; -4,0; 0,-4&gt;          # 4th point to complete the loop and trigger internal fill
up-walking-stick=&lt;0,0; 8,0; 8,6&gt;
truncated=&lt;0,0; 3,1 / 6,2; 9,3 /  12,4; 15,5&gt;          # a sloping dashed line
</pre>

<h4>Circles Ellipses and Arcs</h4>
<p>We use round brackets to delimit the description.</p>

<p>Currently ZMap implements only whole circles and we will extend this to
allow ellipses and fractions of a circle. To define a circular glyph we
specify the bounding box with top left and bottom right coordinates, and then
optionally a start and stop angle in degrees, 0/360 being at 3 o'clock (due to
GDK), angles count up anticlockwise (due to GDK). It appears that ellipses can
only be drawn as vertical or horizontal using GDK.</p>

<pre>
[glyphs]
circle=(-4,-4 4,4)                # a full circle
horizontal-ellipse=(-2,-4 2,4)    # a flat ellipse
lr-circle=(0,0 4,4)               # a small circle offset to below and right of the feature
r-half-moon=(-4,-4 4,4 270 90)    # a half moon on the RHS
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Re-sizing glyphs sized according to a feature's score</h3>

<p>The points used to specify a glyph's size and shape correspond to the
maximum size and when 'glyph-score-mode' is set as width or height then the
pixel coordinates will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>A glyph that scores less than the minimum will not be displayed and a glyph exceeding the maximum will be displayed as for max-score. 'min-score' will likely be one pixel across.</p>

<h3>Aligning Glyphs</h3>
<p>It's a simple concept but there are a few nuances to consider.
<ul>
<li>If not specified, a glyph will be aligned to the centre of its column or feature.
<li>If aligned to the left or right of the column then the style must specify the width
<li>If aligned to the left then the glyph shape must consist of points with +ve/0 x coordinates
<li>If aligned to the right the glyph shape must consist of points with -ve/0 x coordinates
<li>If you use glyph-strand=flip-x then it's best not to use alignment and stick with the centre
<li>Glyphs not conforming to the above may be painted, but may look a bit messy, especially if score-mode=width is used
</ul>

<h3>Handling of styles data</h3>
<h4>Where to store and how to access</h4>
<p>Currently when a canvas item is drawn much of the information used is derived from a style structure but at some point gets copied into some local structure.  The glyphs code makes use of GObject get() and set() functions which inevitably impose an overhead.  Styles are attached to a view and also the window structures, and the reason for copying style data is presumed to be to allow styles to be changed at run time.  Whenever a new view is created the config files are re-read and exisiting views (ie each ZMap) must continue to function as before.  Arguably there is no need to have features displayed using two versions of the same style in one window (in fact this would be confusing for the user) and therefore the style information could be efficiently stored in the window instead of in the canvas item, once per item or by a reference to the style.  However it is not possibly to address this without a review of the whole view - window - canvas item interface and it's not appropriate to do this now.
</p>
<h4>Styles and glyph shapes</h4>
<p>
A glyph shape is a simple data structure and can be stored easily in a style object much like a colour definition. Following current practice a displayed glyph can have the relevant config choices extracted for the style and stored in its glyph object parameters.  This requires the addition of glyph-shape-name glyph-points and glyph-type (or similar).
</p>
<p>In terms of configuration a glyph shape is defined as 'name=shape' where shape includes points and type (lines or circles). For the style object we need to store the name and shape as separate properties, which implies a difference from default config file handling (beyond the fact that we are required to handle user defined names anyway). When reading styles we will have to read the glyphs config first and store this data in the styles - the glyphs data will then be freed as it cannot be accessed from anywhere else due to existing data structure design.</p>
<p>We wish to avoid continually interpreting text into a list of points and if so in the context of GObjects being used for canvas items with no external references we will have to copy the style's shape data structure as a G_PARAM_BOXED parameter.  As glyph shapes must de defined in the main ZMap configuration file they could be stored as a hash table of structures globally in the view (like styles) but unfortunately by the time we get to display a glyph that data is not accessable. A CanvasItem has a feature pointer which has a style, and we are constrained to hold the reference there.  We can convert the text to data in the style and provide an extra interface to extract this data and copy it to the Glyph canvas item.  Doint this via a g_object_get call would require two interfaces to the same parameter and this can be provided at the cost of slowing down object copy functions if necessary.  We can provide a C functions to extract the data structure directly, which will appear like other existing style access functions.  This will not require any major re-organisation of existing data structures.
</p>

<h4>Multiple sub-feature glyphs per style</h4>
<p>Although we can support different glyphs to 5' and 3' ends with current styles there is a need to support multiple sub-features.
</p>
<p>Previous code has handled homology and concensus splice site glyphs to alignments by hard coding these. Splice sites were removed due to clutter and homology glyphs were made configurable by adding an explicit glyph to alignment styles.  For alignments we can easily imaging needing three type of glyph to attach to features: a) incomplete homology markers b) non-concensus splice sites, c) poly A tails and it is not feasable to keep adding data to the styles, although the handling of these glyphs does need to be hard coded as it involves ZMap calculating where and whether or not to display them.</p>
<p>One obvious approach is to code glyphs using separate styles which allow the appearance to be configured but are only used as sub-features. Two simple ways to attatch these to feature (alignment) styles would be:
<ul>
<li>include a list of key-glyph-name pairs in the style (this is the one chosen)
<pre>
[align-xyz]
mode-alignment
sub-features = homology:red-triangles; splice: blue-diamond ;polyA: polyA-tail
</pre>
<li>provide a config stanza to match up hard coded features to glyph styles (not used)
<pre>
[sub-features]
homology = red-triangles
splice = blue-diamond
polyA = polyA-tail
</pre>
</ul>
The first is clearly more flexible and would allow different appearance for different feature columns, and also would allow sub-features to be switched on or off per columm.  Inheritance can be used to maintain consistency among styles.  This would also make the 'glyph-mode' option irrelevant, and allow us to remove some duplication in the styles data.
</p>
<h5>Accessing sub feature styles</h5>
<p>Here it is necessary to follow existing practices.</p>
<p>  When a column is created a list of styles which are necessary to display all the featuresets in the column is created and these are copied to a hash table in the container, and they can be looked up later by unique-id.  When reading in a style's data the id quarks are stored in a short array in the style (sub_feature[]) whcih is indexed by a sub-feature enum.  Sub features are all hard coded and we can predict how many there are.</p>
<p> When creating the column first a list of all styles needed is created by <b>zmapWindowUtils.c/zmapWindowFeatureSetStyles()</b> and this is later passed to <b>zmapWindowContainerFeatureSet.c/zmapWindowContainerFeatureSetAugment</b> whcih takes a copy of the actual styles data and stored this in a hash table in the container.  <b>zmapWindowFeatureSetStyles()</b> has access to a global list of styles for the window, which may be a copy of the styles known to the view.
</p>
<p>To add sub-feature styles to this table <b>zmapWindowFeatureSetStyles()</b> must find these for each style it adds to the list by looking up the id in the window's style table and add these to its list.  As the id's are simple quarks the style config can be read in without any resource deadlocks; when the container hash table of styles is created all the relevant styles have already been created and are accessable.
</p>

<h4>Glyph Canvas Items</h4>
<p>A glyph item is a zmapWindowCanvasItem yet is created by a call to foo_canvas_item_new() which creates an object of the requested type. Sub feature glyphs are created in <b>zmapWindowCollectionFeature.c/markMatchIfIncomplete()</b> and also <b>zMapWindowCollectionFeatureAddSpliceMarkers()</b>.  Gylph mode features get added as plain zmapWindowCanvasItems.
Currently the only glyph mode features used are the splice marker triangles and there is some old #iffed out code in <b>zmapWindowItemFactory.c/drawGlyphFeature()</b> that uses the <b>zMapDrawGlyph()</b> function in zmapDraw.c; instead a plain canvas item is created.</p>
<p>
ACEDB provides a GF_splice style which is defined as mode glyph and glyph_mode <b>ZMAPSTYLE_GLYPH_SPLICE</b>, and other than config code this glyph-mode is only referenced in <b>zmapWindowBasicFeature.c/zmap_window_basic_feature_add_interval()</b> where the RH triangles are hard coded.  This function calls foo_canvas_item_new() asking for a <b>ZMAP_TYPE_WINDOW_GLYPH_ITEM</b>. This item type is only referenced once elsewhere in <b>zmapWindowCanvasItem.c/zmap_window_canvas_item_set_colour()</b>.  However, in <b>zmapWindowCollectionFeature.c</b> there are three references to <b>zMapWindowGlyphItemGetType()</b> which is the same thing. So... it does appear that glyphs end up as the same things regardless of being features or sub-features and the existing code can simply be tweaked to use configured data. </p>

<p><b>zmapFeature.c/addFeatureModeCB()</b> also sets mode glyph in any style called "Gf_Splice", although experiments reveal that this function (which is to patch up some ACEDB issues) does not appear to be called - this is according to some 'has modes' flag.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A new function (<b>zMapWindowGlyphItemCreate()</b>) will be provided by zmapWindowGlyphItem.c which will draw a glyph (via a foo_canvas_item_new() call) given its style and some context parameters.
</p>
<p>So...
<ul>
<li><b>drawGlyphFeature()</b> calls <b>zMapWindowCanvasItemAddInterval()</b> which calls <b>zmap_window_basic_feature_add_interval()</b>
<li>instead of hard coding RH triangles we can re-use the #iffed-out code from <b>drawGlyphFeature()</b> to drive the choice of up/down hooks and variable sizing
<li>we can also default some glyph styles to retro fit the old splice markers without modern configuration options
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Data structures summarised</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Compatablility with existing practices is aimed for
<li>Glyph shapes are defined in the main ZMap configuration file as simple text strings referenced by name
<li>Glyph names are stored as quarks in the style data structure
<li>Glyph shapes are stored as binary data in the style structure and the g_object interface (get and set) for these is via G_BOXED data types
<li>Glyph canvas item parameters are set via the g_object interface
<li>Glyph canvas items do not provide a g_object_get() interface
<li>Style merge and copy will operate on the binary version of the shape data.
<li>Sub-feature glyph styles are referenced via a small array of style Quark ID's, indexed by a sub-feature enum.
</ul>
This fulfills the requirements of having copies of all config data per view.
</p>
<p>Note that to access the same data structure in zmapStyle.c and also zmapWindowGlyphItem.c we have to make this public and include zmapStyle.h in the glyph code, which makes it the only CanvasItem module including styles data.

</fieldset>
<fieldset><legend>Legacy issues</legend>
<h4>Styles files</h4>
<p>Handling legacy styles data from ACEDB needs some thought (it used to be hard coded) and the following is proposed:
<ul>
<li>We will migrate to config file based style definition
<li>New options have not been programmed into the ACEDB interface.
<li>Each data server will have its own stylesfile config and if not specified the server is to supply styles itself
<li>If styles are sourced from a config file then all glyph features must be specified, or else sub-features will not be displayed. This is necessary to allow features to be turned on or off depending on the column.
<li>If styles are sourced from ACEDB and no sub-feature glyphs are specified then the previous hard coded behaviour will be maintained (homology red-diamonds) and enhanced (replaced by up and down triangles). This will be done by hard coding the relevant style.  NB you have to turn on 'legacy_styles' in [ZMap] to have this happen.
<li>If no 3-Frame splice marker glyphs are configured then a similar process will be used for these.
<li>(Global) config options will be provided to switch this on or off eg:
<pre>
[ZMap]
legacy_glyphs=true
</pre>
Note that this option will only be set on ZMap startup and not on creation of a new ZMap window. This is due to the fact that we don't want to read in the config file when drawing each glyph. It could be set on view creation, but it is only a legacy option.
</ul>
</p>
<h4>other stuff...</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>zmapFeature.c #2831 addFeatureModeCB() appears to be bodging up some hard coded values. This function is about setting the style mode (why is it needed?) and should not be setting colours? The source of the style data (acedbServer.c in this case) should manage these defaults.  Other functions zMapFeatureAnyAddModesToStyles() and zMapFeatureAnyForceModesToStyles() are implicated and it looks like a temporary fix for something has been perpetrated.
<li>zmapGFF2parser.c/makeNewFeature() sets the feature type from the style, the opposite of what addFeatureModeCB() does.
<li>the style 'GF_splice' from acedb does not define a glyph type (this was hard coded in ZMap as above).  Another function has been created to restore previous functionality for homology markers - if glyphs are not configured then these are installed in the relevant styles on demand - the code will work using configurable glyphs so we can move forwards.
<b>Note that for 3-frame splice we operate on an explicit style with a unique-id of 'gf-splice' and this name must not be changed</b>.
<li>zmap_window_glyph_item_point() needs to be revisited esp re arcs
<li>zmapWindowDump.c creates PDFs from the window/ view.  Glyph items are not drawn as foo canvas items so we have some special code added to bodge these up, which breaks the modularity as designed.  We need to resolve this!   One way would be to have feature mode glyphs as zmap canvas items which include foo shapes in the same way as normal features...
</ul></p>
