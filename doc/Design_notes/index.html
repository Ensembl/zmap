<h2>ZMap Design Documentation</h2>

<br />

<fieldset>
<legend>Pages Under Construction</legend>
<p>The documentation pages are being re-organised and updated. </p>
<p>Some old files are held in ZMap/web and will be moved into ZMap/doc on a gradual basis.  The ZMap/Web directory will be maintained during this process as some build scripts depend on it and as the files are in the CVS it provides a backup.  Some other files that have been deleted from ZMap/doc have been move to ZMap/doc/old on ~mh17 until they get transferred to the new directory tree.
</p>
<p>As files get added or copied or converted they will hopefully get added to this index page, which is intended to be in alpha order. As the number of files increase then we'll add some nice &lt;div&gt;s to put them in pretty columns.

<h3>Some things that need investigating and writing up.</h3>
<p><ul>
<li><p>X-Remote appears to talk to zmapControl, zmapView, and zmapWindow, so far. Who is in control?</p>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Things that are slow</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>3-Frame takes a while to paint, likely due to having to do a lot of sums, but hiding it should simply be a matter of hiding the columns, after which a re-painting would also be quick.
</ul>
</p>

</fieldset>

<fieldset><legend>Unfinished Buisness</legend>
<p>
<ul>
<li>delayed server needs to free view_con->context etc etc (memory leak)
<li>implement X-Remote progress message (source finished has been done, need more detail ie % complete.
<li>sequence server is assumed to be ACEDB or some other server that is not delayed and there can be only one
<li>Styles have 3 fields that appear to be misplaced as they refer to column data: loaded, deferred, and cur_bump_mode. Most importantly <b>deferred styles</b> need to be looked at esp as commented around <b>zmapViewRemoteReceive.c #1242</b>
<li><a href="Design_notes/modules/zmapView.shtml#DNA_memory">Scope and memory allocation issues</a> with DNA sequence data
<li>zMapFeaturesetCreateID() and zmapStyleCreateId() and ZMapGFFSet and ZMapGFFSource could benefit from a review.  The problem is that sometimes we want names normalised and sometimes we want them capitalised as given.  Perhaps the best way woule be to have all key values as normalised and duplicate quarks used for display names.  There are 86 calls to these functions, and this in not all the code that would have to be checked.
<li><b>NC-Splice</b> markers - need to verify if correct or not, need some test data.  Currently coded as previously which does display, Jmaes' recommendations also available (iffed out) but do not produce any output.
</ul>
</p>

<fieldset><legend>Things to fix</legend>
<p>
Here's a list of suspicious bits of code encountered while looking for something else
<ul>
<li><b>In zmpWindowCanvasItem.c zMapWindowCanvasItemGetBounds()</b> looks like a cut &amp; paste of <b>zMapWindowCanvasItemGetFeature()</b>  directly above it including the explanatory comment. It's not called from anywhere.
</ul>
