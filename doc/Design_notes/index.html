<h2>ZMap Design Documentation</h2>

<br />

<fieldset>
<legend>Pages Under Construction</legend>
<p>The documentation pages are being re-organised and updated. </p>
<p>Some old files are held in ZMap/web and will be moved into ZMap/doc on a gradual basis.  The ZMap/Web directory will be maintained during this process as some build scripts depend on it and as the files are in the CVS it provides a backup.  Some other files that have been deleted from ZMap/doc have been copied to ~mh17/zmap/doc.old and ~mh17/zmap/web.old until they get transferred to the new CVS directory tree.
</p>
<p>As files get added or copied or converted they will hopefully get added to this index page, which is intended to be in alpha order. As the number of files increase then we'll add some nice &lt;div&gt;s to put them in pretty columns.

<fieldset><legend>Unfinished Buisness</legend>
<p>
<ul>
<li>delayed server needs to free view_con->context etc etc (memory leak)
<li>sequence server is assumed to be ACEDB or some other server that is not delayed and there can be only one
<li>Styles have 3 fields that appear to be misplaced as they refer to column data: loaded, deferred, and cur_bump_mode. Most importantly <b>deferred styles</b> need to be looked at esp as commented around <b>zmapViewRemoteReceive.c #1242</b>
<li><a href="Design_notes/modules/zmapView.shtml#DNA_memory">Scope and memory allocation issues</a> with DNA sequence data
<li>zMapFeaturesetCreateID() and zmapStyleCreateId() and ZMapGFFSet and ZMapGFFSource could benefit from a review.  The problem is that sometimes we want names normalised and sometimes we want them capitalised as given.  Perhaps the best way woule be to have all key values as normalised and duplicate quarks used for display names.  There are 86 calls to these functions, and this is not all the code that would have to be checked.
<li><b>NC-Splice</b> markers - need to verify if correct or not, need some test data.  Currently coded as James' recommendations

<li><b>zMapViewLoadFeatures()</b> is called for <b>OTF data requests</b> after the initial load, and featuresets etc are concatenated not merged. The server interface has some loose ends relating to whether or not the report all supported featuresets of just those requested, and currently theyeturn all styles not just those needed. Needs a tidy up.
<li> ZMapView->columns needs to be a new struct. This should handle column ordering and also column bump state. zmapWindow->feature_set_names is currently used for this and need to be replaced - it's left as is right now as support for old ACE connectuons needs it.

<li>Locus features are apparently created via some kludge which causes some problems when deleting features. This and the naviagtor-sets needs a review. see eg <b>zmapViewRemoteRecieve.c #1601</b>.

</ul>

<fieldset><legend>Things to fix</legend>
<p>
Here's a list of suspicious bits of code encountered while looking for something else
<ul>
<li><b>In zmpWindowCanvasItem.c zMapWindowCanvasItemGetBounds()</b> looks like a cut &amp; paste of <b>zMapWindowCanvasItemGetFeature()</b>  directly above it including the explanatory comment. It's not called from anywhere.
</ul>
