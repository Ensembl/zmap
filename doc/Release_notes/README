This directory contains the release notes for ZMap.


Release notes include:

- the code releases version numbers of zmap and acedb

- which request tracker tickets were resolved, these are obtained
using the ticket search page by setting the queue to zmap or whatever
and then setting the "before/after" criteria to

status = resolved
when = after
date = dd/mm/yyyy



- features added/fixed for zmap

Need to run /nfs/team71/acedb/zmap/prefix/scripts/cvschanges to list these.


- features added/fixed for acedb



When creating a new set of release notes you should:


1) Copy release_notes_template.shtml as your template to ensure consistency of notes.

2) Run the script XXXX to automate as much as possible of the release note process.
Some parts cannot be automated, e.g. the Request Tracker stuff.
