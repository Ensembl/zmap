ZMap - items for lace integration
---------------------------------


The plan is to put zmap into test_otterlace straight away even though we know
not everything that is required is implemented yet. Liz/Charlie will be the
guinea pigs for the test initially. We will meet again in a month to review
how it's gone and what we need to do next.



Priorities:
-----------

*** Do right now
**  Do this month
*   Think about



Configuration
-------------

*
- need to be able to do "per team" configurations of different parts of zmap
(e.g. of what goes in the cut buffer and in what format).



Transcript operations
---------------------


** EG doing this. <DONE>
- contextual menu on gene object:
     + show CDS translation in zmap
     + show CDS translation (including *stopcodon) in separate (copy-pastable)
     window
     + export CDS translation (fasta seq saved to file)
     + show CDS sequence (nucleotide seq of CDS incl stop codon) in separate
     (copy-pastable) window
     + export CDS sequence (fasta of nucleotide seq of CDS incl stop codon
     saved to a file)

     + export entire mRNA sequence (fasta seq saved to file)
     + show entire mRNA sequence in separate (copy-pastable) window

     + export genomic sequence of transcript (fasta seq saved to file)
       (we could colour the genomic span when displayed in a separate
       window to make it obvious which are exons and which introns.

EG acedb has translation code which handles different translation tables, I
will pinch the code....

I have a comment about showing the size of a protein translation, I think this
might be in the status line if you click on the translation ?
<DONE>



**
- objects should carry http links so that web pages (e.g. ensemble/pfam) that
carry more information about them can be displayed.

EG Sequence class has a web_location tag which points to a url object, this is
quite complex and poorly documented so I will need to look in the code....so
it maybe very simple for us to add this.


*
- pattern or word search (peptide and nucleotide) of genomic seq as currently
under "restriction enzyme digest" and highlight results in fmap (currently
when DNA is shown, highlighted with colored background (different colors for
forward and reverse match) and also the matches are indicated by printing out
the search term in a column close to the central yellow divider)

EG This is probably best implemented by lace doing a patten search and then
sending us the results as a new column + matches that we need to draw as
"features" in the column.



Display stuff
-------------

***
- copy-paste from pfetch text window
EG I think this is done already via gtk text widget..
<DONE>


**
- display ORF's
EG I will hack ace server to allow ORFs to be dumped.



**
- need 3 frame translation in the window.
- show ORFs in all three frames (i.e. show stopcodons)
- show 3-frame translation of genomic seq (sequence selectable and copyable
like dna seq above)


**
- clicking on a transcript or exon should highlight that exons dna if the dna
is displayed (agreed that dna could be highlighted by colouring the
background).
- if dna seq is shown, highlight the extent of any box/feature user clicks on.


*** EG THIS IS DONE APART FROM THE RESTORE DEFAULT BUTTON, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS
IN ACEDB SO ITS NOT THAT GREAT A PRIORITY...
- column configuration should be a main button in the zmap window, should be
able to reset to defaults with single click....perhaps reset should reset the
whole interface.
- "configure all columns" button in button bar at top (currently a submenu in
column contextual menu)
- "restore global default" button in button bar at top (i.e. restore default
columns etc.)


<DONE>
- double clicking on an object should display the "properties" window.
- double click (proper double click !!!) on a feature and get a "property
inspector" window (like tree display in fmap). Possibly super-user (but not
user!) configurable
<DONE>


*** RDS_DOING_THIS
- put the scale by the yellow strand separator



*** RDS_DOING_THIS
- cut displayed DNA direct into the cut buffer for access from other 
applications.
- when dna seq is shown in zmap, select a stretch of sequence -> contextual
menu item "copy" or it could happen automatically


**
- allow printing of the current zmap to a file
- postscript printing the zmap

EG acedb does this by steam and we could pinch the code.


*** RDS_DOING_THIS
- clicking on a column will turn the background of that column to light grey
to emphasise that it has been selected.
- trial of subtly highlighting entire column background when left-clicking on
the column background
<DONE>

***
- each sub window of a zmap should contain more information in the title which
should include at least the species.


*
- the current left hand scroll bar should be replaced with a locator which
shows clone position/direction/overlaps/names in a similar "stepped" display
as fmap does currently. We could also put a scale in this window.
- canvas with clone tiling path (with names) on the left and proprtional
scroll thumb for navigational purposes.


**
- users should be able to lock windows together in positions they choose.



Blixem
------

*
- there should be more communication between blixem and zmap so that things
clicked on in zmap get highlighted in zmap and vice versa. Probably we need to
fork blixem so that we can leave behind the old acedb version.



Genefinder
----------

*
we can get the genefinder information from gifaceserver but it requires a
change to the server to the ORFs output and we need to decide whether to get
it all at the start or to get some later...
- genefinder features (start codons (with Kozak score), coding potential,
splice sites, etc.)
