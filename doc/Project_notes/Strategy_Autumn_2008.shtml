<TITLE>ZMap Strategy/Goals for Autumn 2008/Spring 2009</TITLE>

<H1>Overview</H1>

<p>We have been bug fixing and bug fixing but now we need to make some larger
changes again.


<H1>Goals</H1>


<H3>Improving Testing</H3>

<p>
ZMap could be tested by adding code so that zmap would run off GFF and
styles files. This could be done in batch and commands sent to zmap from
Roys X Atoms/Properties interface tester. Zmap could also dump data so
allowing diff'ing of output files to catch changes in data positions/types etc.
</p>


<p>
The following pieces of code would be required to do this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>The GFF file reader code would need to be revamped.</p>
  <li><p>The Styles file reader would need to be revamped.</p>
  <li><p>The GFF dumper would need to be revamped.</p>
  <li><p>We should add a complete context dumper (including styles).</p>
  <li><p>Roys command program should be able to take a file containing a
      list of commands and pass them over.</p>
  <li><p>We should also diff the zmap log file.</p>
</ul>
