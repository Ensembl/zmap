Paper on new annotation clients using interclient comms...

check what gmod does

use the unix model...tools that have one purpose, separation of concerns etc.

show our model and quote suzi lewis and what she would like to do

talk about dynamic loading (plugins)...




Abstract

Genome Browsers and annotation programs have generally been linked
to just one underlying database schema. ZMap is a genome browser
that can be controlled by an external program so that it can be
integrated into an existing annotation system. ZMap separates
out the display of genome features from the database schema to provide
a general purpose display engine.



Introduction

From the start of sequence analysis visualisation of the sequence
and the features of that sequence have been and continue to be
very important. Traditionally sequence annotation
software has operated on data with just one schema and this is
for good reasons. It is not currently possible to produce some
"meta" description of all the popular database schemas that would
allow one piece of software to annotate all databases. The underlying
semantics differ considerably and are often not logically consistent.

ZMap separates out the viewer tasks from the task of editting schema-specific
data.
