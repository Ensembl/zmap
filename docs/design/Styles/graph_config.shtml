<h2>Style Configuration for Graph Items</h2>

<p>Refer also to <a href="../Display/density.shtml">Density Plots</a> for a
implementation details and some sample pictures.  </p>

<h3>Types of graph supported by ZMap</h3>

<p>Historically ZMap has supported only histogram type graphs and thee have
been used eg for Phast_cons data. This consists of widely variable sized
features with different scores depending on the level of conservation and the
size fo the regions.  </p>

<p> More recently coverage (density) plots have been implemented and these are
available as histograms, heatmaps, and line (wiggle) plots.  The density plot
code can also display original style histograms and it is intended to phase out
the orginal code.  </p>

<p>In the short term the orginal code can be used by using the same style
definition as before and adding the option &apos;<b>foo=true</b>&apos;.  </p>

<h3>New style configuration options</h3> <p> These should all appear in a graph
mode style definition.  </p>

<p> <pre> graph-mode=heatmap | line | histogram </pre> chooses the graph type.
Heatmaps vary between the fill colour (min-score) and the border (max-score)
and can change from blue to red if you like.  White is good as zero as it
blends into the column background nicely. Wiggle plots get joined up if there
are gaps between features.  </p>

<p> <pre> graph-density-show_zero=true </pre> Not implemented.  </p> <p>

<pre> graph-density=true </pre> enables re-binning of data depending on zoom
level, which allows the efficient display of large amounts of coverage data.
For example if you have 300k of sequence and 40bp bins then that's 7500
features. At min zoom you can see max 1000.  Re-binning combines several bins
into one and takes the maximum score of the source bins as the one
displayed. Clicking on the bin selects that source feature.  Note that
currently it is assumed that all score values are positive.  </p>

<p> <pre> graph-density-fixed=true </pre> selects whether or not to use fixed
size bins.  Nominally fixed size bins are all integer numbers of pixels deep
and are all the same size (eg by dividing the column's display into fixed size
rows, and pro-rating source bins that overlap two display ones), but is certain
circumstances this may differ, especially at high zoom.  If a source bin is
bigger than the nominal display bin size then the display bin will expand.
Normally small source bins are combined into one display bin with a minimum
size, but if short bins preceed a large bin this may result in a display bin
smaller than expected, as illustrated here: <br /><b>TBD:</b> <img

<p> <pre> graph-density-min-bin=4 </pre> sets the minimum bin size for display
in pixels.  The default (4) is the smallest histogram bin that can be easily
clicked on (subjectively, for me).  Line plots look better with a relatively
wide bin despite the fact that this looses detail. Histograms are usually
displayed as coloured boxes with an outline and a size of less than 3 pixels
means no fill colour will be visible. Heatmaps work best out of the three type
with high resolution but it's not clear that a bin size of less than 2 is any
use - the point of coverage displays is to highlight where the data is, and
users can zoom in quite quickly.  </p> <p> <pre> graph-scale=log </pre> If
selected then source data (score) is converted to a log value. If the source
data is already log scale do not select this!  </p> <p> <pre>
graph-density-stagger=12 </pre> offsets a column of graph data by the specified
number of pixels.  This is intended to allow several graphs to be combined into
one column (eg a series of heatmaps showing differential expression - set
stagger to be 1 greater the the column width.  It's possible to stagger wiggle
plots by less, but at low zoom you will get some overlap, and if you do it may
be wise to colour code the graphs.  Each graph column is ordered by ZMap's
column configuration eg: <pre> [columns] coverage=liver;heart;brain;kidney
</pre> will stagger the data in that order.  Using the option instead of
displaying each graph in its own column allows all the be displayed or hidden
in a single operation.  </p>


<p> <pre> default-bump-mode=style </pre> (not restricted to graph mode styles).
If selected column bump will redisplay the column using an alternate style.
</p>

<p> <pre> bump-style=line </pre> sets the alternate style to be used for
bumping.  </p>

<h3>An example: (compact) heatmap style bumping to overlapping wiggle</h3>
Laurens' original request was for histograms but when shown the cubans prefered
wiggle, but it's easy to change.  <pre> [heatmap] width=8 colours=normal fill
white; normal border black #max-mag=1000.000000 graph-baseline=0.000000
max-score=1000.000000 mode=graph min-score=0.000000 graph-mode=heatmap
graph-density=true graph-density-fixed=true graph-density-min-bin=2
graph-density-stagger=9 graph-scale=log bump-style=line default-bump-mode=style

[line] width=40.000000 colours=normal border blue graph-baseline=0.000000
max-score=1000.000000 mode=graph min-score=0.000000 graph-mode=line
graph-density=true graph-density-fixed=true graph-density-min-bin=4
graph-density-stagger=20 graph-scale=log </pre> and in ZMap config:

<pre> [columns] coverage= liver; heart; brain

[featureset-style] liver = heatmap heart = heatmap brain = heatmap </pre> </p>

<h3>Supporting old graph styles with new code</h3> The following two styles are
equivalent but the second should display more effciently at low zoom. If the
first is used and foo not specified then it displays all the features as
overlapping as for traditonal ZMap, but uses new code.  <pre> [histogram] # old
style width=60.000000 colours=normal fill Green1 ; normal border Green3
graph-baseline=0.000000 max-score=1000.000000 mode=graph min-score=0.000000
graph-mode=histogram bump-fixed=true foo=true # true for old code; false for
new </pre>

<pre> [histogram] # new style width=60.000000 colours=normal fill Green1 ;
normal border Green3 graph-baseline=0.000000 max-score=1000.000000 mode=graph
min-score=0.000000 graph-mode=histogram graph-density=true
graph-density-fixed=false graph-density-min-bin=1 bump-fixed=true </pre>


</p>

<h3>Select and highlight</h3> <p> Traditionally clicking on a feature will
display some information in the Zmap status bar and highlight the feature (if
it's big enough to see the highlight).  Highlight has been implemented for
histograms but not for heatmaps or lines.  Select (and status information) work
for all three types but for composite bins the feature with the highest score
is chosen.  If graphs (eg wiggle plots) are displayed overlapped then it's not
always possible to select the feature you want - select operates on a column
wide box not the line segment.
