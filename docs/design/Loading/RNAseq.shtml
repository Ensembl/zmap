<h2>OTF requests for RNA seq data</h2>

<h2>As requested by Laurens (RT 180043)</h2>

<p> For displaying on-demand rna-seq data, i.e. only data for the marked
region, we propose interfaces and map displays as in the two attached mock-ups.
</p> <p> For the column chooser window I've created a third tab where we can
select which of the four types of displays (gene models, introns, coverage and
reads) for each of the four different data sets (tissue, cell type and
developmental stage, and other) we want to display. The "Display All" buttons
of course operate on the column or row they align with (forgive me the awkward
spacing of the columns).  </p> <p> In zmap the columns could look like what is
displayed in the mock-up. Default for all columns except gene models would be
unbumped (compressed/condensed). The coverage bar graph would be on a
logarithmic scale. The condensed form of that column, the heat map, wouldn't be
sufficient on its own as heat maps are fine for comparing levels between
neighbours, but not for comparing medium/long-distance levels as it suffers
from the well-known context dependent apparent density level problem (i.e. the
same shade surrounded by black neighbours looks much, much lighter than when
surrounded by white neighbours).  </p>

<h2>How to implement</h2> <p> Please feel free to update this with your ideas
and thoughts</p> <h3>Requesting data from a marked region</h3> <p>The existing
pipe server mechanism could be used to request data as specified in the
complicated dialog between the coordinates defined by the marked region. Note
that seperate control will have ot be provided for display and data requests,
unless we just load automatically if the data is not present</p>

<h3>Displaying coverage data</h3> <p>Refer to <a
href="../Display/density.shtml">Density Plots</a> for some notes about displaying
coverage data - ZMap will calculate graphs and heat maps as this allows exact
mapping to display pixels.
