This directory contains the following files which make up the ZMap User manual:

ZMap_User_Manual.tex - the source for the manual, in Latex format

ZMap_User_Manual.pdf - the PDF version of the manual for distribution. This is generated by
                       running the command:

                           pdflatex ZMap_User_Manual

                       in this directory TWICE (running twice is required to make sure the 
                       cross references are all up to date). Long term we should remove this
                       file from the repository and have our build system run pdflatex.

ZMap_User_Manual.aux - generated file (can be ignored)
ZMap_User_Manual.log - generated file (can be ignored)
ZMap_User_Manual.out - generated file (can be ignored)
ZMap_User_Manual.toc - generated file (can be ignored)

images               - this directory contains all of the images that are referenced from
                       the ZMap_User_Manual.tex document. To change an image, e.g. with an
                       updated screenshot, you can simply overwrite the original image with
                       a new one of the same name and re-generate the pdf file.
