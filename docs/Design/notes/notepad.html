<h2>Notepad window to help organise multiple features</h2>
<p><b>NOTE</b>this is a very short place holder for notes TBD</p>

There are a number of circumstances when annotators wsih to do things with groups of features eg:
<ul>
<li> hide/show selected
<li> <a href="Design_notes/notes/otter_zmap.shtml#dotter">mega-dotter</a> with a set of transcripts and alignments
</ul>
and it is proposed to provied a notepad window where lists of features may be assembled in multiple tabs and actions performed on them via a drop down menu.  For example the current stack of hidden items that is driven by focus/select and keystroke could be replaced by a dialog with visible lists of feature names, and these could be selected for show or hide in any order, providing enhanced function with a more explicit user interface.
