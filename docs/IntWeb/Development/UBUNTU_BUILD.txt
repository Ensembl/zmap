                         Ubuntu Build Support


My thesis is this: with ubuntu we are _not_ stepping up to supporting multiple
versions of linux simultaneously, we will have two versions for a short period
only, i.e.

                               debian
                        ----------------|stops|
 linux (= debian)      /                         linux (= ubuntu)
-----------------------                      -----------------------
                       \                    /
                        --------------------
                               ubuntu



Therefore we do not need complicated version recognising build systems but
simply to rejig our existing build system to make either debian or ubuntu
builds on a temporary (i.e. hacked) basis. Once we are all using ubuntu then
our build systems can just run as always....


Here is what I've done to make this possible:


1) Ran the zmap build on linux/debian to produce a 'lenny' production build,
this build is in /nfs/zmap/BUILDS/PRODUCTION_BUILDS/ZMap.0-1-136.BUILD.debian
but is more succinctly referenced as ~zmap/BUILD.PRODUCTION and as
~zmap/BUILD.PRODUCTION.debian


2) The current tviewsrv-compiled acedb binaries run on ubuntu so no need to do
anything but if I did need to I'd just need to edit updatetree and change the
build list to include deskpro17537 instead of tviewsrv.


3) The seqtools binaries also just run on ubuntu so no need to do anything.


4) Instructions for hacking our build for ubuntu:


 temporarily hacked the zmap build list in ZMap/scripts/build_config.sh to
replace tviewsrv with deskpro17537 while I did a production build. This was
done in the develop branch as that's how the build system works....could
revist this though and allow checking out of the different build branches.

> su zmap

> cd ~zmap/BUILD_CHECKOUT/



5) Did a new production zmap build but with all ubuntu code, this build is
in /nfs/zmap/BUILDS/PRODUCTION_BUILDS/ZMap.0-1-136.BUILD.ubuntu but is more
succinctly referenced as ~zmap/BUILD.PRODUCTION.ubuntu
