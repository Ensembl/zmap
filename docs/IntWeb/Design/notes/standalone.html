<h2>Standlone Operation</h2>

<fieldset><legend>Configuration</legend>
<p>Overwhelmingly ZMAp is used in conjunction with Otterlace and Otterlace provides configuration to define data sources etc and also some request data via the XRemote protocol. Data sources are specifed with a lengthy URL whcih include options for each source and some of these are common eg start and end coordinates, which are supplied by ZMap, and must be for functions such as 'Request from Mark'.
</p>
<p>
There are a few otehr arguments common to all scripts which relate to the sequence and for consistency, and to allow easy configuration for standalone operation, it would be good to define these in another stanza:
<table border="1"  cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
<tr> <td>sequence </td> <td>The name of the sequence eg 'chr6-18'</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>dataset </td> <td>eg 'human' </td> </tr>
</table>
Note that the sequence name appears in pipe server script arguments as both 'gff_seqname' and 'type'.
</p>

<p>These could go into the [ZMap] stanza as currently do start and end coordinates, but perhaps a better solution would be to create a stanza for each sequence of interest, with the name being the sequence name.
These could go in a separate file in a similar manner to styles configuration.

<p>As Blixem also has to call a script to request short reads data, these arguments are also relevant <a href="Design/notes/BAM.shtml">here</a>
