<h2>ZMap: Splice Highlighting</h2>



<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This document describes the design of splice highlighting within zmap.</p>

<p>Annotators frequently want to know if coordinates of features match, e.g. if
a particular match (EST, cDNA etc) aligns to within a certain tolerance to the
exons of a transcript. The easiest way to do this is to allow the annotator to
click on the feature they are interested in and then automatically highlight
features in other columns that have the same start or end coordinates as that
feature.</p>

<p>This facility is commonly referred to as:</p>

<p class=tab><b>splice highlighting</b></p>

<p>The below images show highlighting turned on and off.</p>

<img src="Splice_highlight_off.tiff" class="img" alt="splice highlighting off">
<img src="Splice_highlight_on.tiff" class="img" alt="splice highlighting on">

<p>The highlighted feature is a protein coding primary transcript and the splice
highlighted features are BLAT EST alignments.</p>



<h3>User Interface</h3>


<p>Select a feature and then press <b>'s'</b> to see highlighted in red all the
start/ends of features in other columns that match the highlighted features
start/ends, e.g. highlight a transcript, press <b>'s'</b> and you will be able to see
all the EST's, mRNA's and other features that line up with the transcript.</p>

<p>Some usage notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the highlighting only works on the "box-like" features, it does not include
graph or heatmap data.</p></li>

<li><p>you can select any box-like feature in any column and use the highlighting so
you can select a transcript and see which EST's match it or conversely select an
EST and see which transcripts match it and so on.</p></li>

<li><p>the <b>'s'</b> key toggles the highlighting on/off and you may find it useful to
flick it on/off as it makes it easier to spot the highlights as they blink on
and off, this is particularly so if you are zoomed right out.</p></li>

<li><p>the highlights are drawn in columns whether they are bumped or not but of
course to actually see which features are highlighted you will need to bump the
relevant column.</p></li>

<li><p>if you have selected a feature, pressed <b>'s'</b> and now find that you want to bump
a column follow this procedure:</p></li>

<ol>
        <li><p>select the column and bump it, you will see all the splices.</p></li>

        <li><p>restore the selected feature by pressing <b>shift-h</b>.</p></li>

        <li><p>now you can continue to highlight splices with the reselected feature by pressing <b>'s'</b>.</p></li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>You should note that each time you press the <b>'s'</b> key the currently
highlighted feature will become the new "stored highlighted feature" accessed by
pressing <b>shift-h</b>. If you accidentally splice highlight the wrong feature
simply click on your original feature and press <b>'s'</b> again.</p>


<h3>Design</h3>


<h4>Making features "splice sensitive"</h4>

<p>Which feature sets are "splice sensitive" is controlled by a setting in the
styles for those feature sets, there are two reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some columns contain data where splice matches have no meaning and so
should be excluded.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the number of columns displayed is very large performance 
considerations may make it necessary to restrict the number that are
splice sensitive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition some features (e.g. protein matches) may require that the
highlighting should be done allowing some "slop" in the splice coordinates.</p>

<p>New "splice" keywords have been added to the style to support these
features:</p>

<pre>

[some_style]
splice-highlight = true
splice-highlight-tolerance = 2

</pre>



<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p><b>Coding</b></p>

<p>Division of coding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>zmapWindow/zmapWindow.c, keyboardEvent() - </b>
<ul>
<li>calls zmapWindowContainerFeatureSetSpliceHighlightFeatures() and
zmapWindowContainerFeatureSetSpliceUnhighlightFeatures() to highlight/unhighlight splices.</li>
<li>Manages store/restore of highlighted features.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowContainerFeatureSet.c, zmapWindowContainerFeatureSetAugment() - </b>
<ul>
<li>records if a column should be spliced highlighted.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowContainerFeatureSet.c, zmapWindowContainerFeatureSetSpliceHighlightFeatures() - </b>
<ul>
<li>unhighlights any existing splice highlighting.</li>
<li>finds the highlighted features splice sites coords.</li>
<li>highlights all matching splice sites in all splice-aware columns.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowContainerFeatureSet.c, zmapWindowContainerFeatureSetSpliceUnhighlightFeatures() - </b>
<ul>
<li>unhighlight all existing splice highlights.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>


<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowCanvasDraw.c, zMapCanvasFeaturesetDrawSpliceHighlights() - </b>
<ul>
<li>draw the splice highlights.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowCanvasAlignment.c, zMapWindowCanvasAlignmentPaintFeature() - </b>
<ul>
<li>calls zMapCanvasFeaturesetDrawSpliceHighlights() to draw align splice highlights.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowCanvasBasic.c, basicPaintFeature() - </b>
<ul>
<li>calls zMapCanvasFeaturesetDrawSpliceHighlights() to draw align splice highlights.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>zmapWindow/canvas/zmapWindowCanvasTranscript.c, transcriptPaintFeature() - </b>
<ul>
<li>calls zMapCanvasFeaturesetDrawSpliceHighlights() to draw align splice highlights.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

</ul>



<p><b>Pre-display</b></p>

<p>As featuresets are loaded their styles are tested to see if they should be
splice highlighted and if any featureset should be highlighted then
the column is marked for highlighting.</p>


<p>When a column is to be highlighted then the style setting for splice
highlighting for each featureset within the column will determine if those
features are splice highlighted. If set the splice_highlight_tolerance
for each featureset is used to determine splice highlights.</p>

<p>For each feature within in a column that is to be highlighted two actions
are taken:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A record is made of the feature in a list held on the column so it can be
unhighlighted efficiently.</p></li>

<li><p>The splices to be highlighted in a feature are recorded in the ZMapWindowCanvasFeature
struct for use in the drawing routines. This ensures that the splice markers
are correctly positioned on column bumping.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><b>Drawing</b></p>

<p>As each feature is drawn it's x and y positions are determined, these are then
used as input to the zMapCanvasFeaturesetDrawSpliceHighlights() function. Currently
there is a single splice highlight colour (standard X Windows colour "red") and this
is not customisable. It is likely that just having a single highlight colour is
easier for people to spot (as with the existing feature highlighting) so this is
probably adequate.</p>
