<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>ZMap has been around for a number of years and while the underlying
software has always been foocanvas there have been a 3 major versions
to the way in which the foocanvas was used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Originally each feature was decomposed into individual foocanvas items (e.g. boxes,
      lines or glyphs etc.) and then these individual items were drawn. This method had
      the advantage of simplicity and reasonable performance but led to some
      clumsy coding to group items into features, e.g. box/lines into a transcript for
      event handling, highlighting etc.</p></li>
  <li><p>A second effort subclassed existing foocanvas items to produce new zmapfoocanvas
      items that represented complex features such as transcripts. While this approach
      made the coding simpler it was disastrous for performance: alignments (by far the
      most numerous feature) were no longer represented by a single box but became a
      foocanavas group containing not just the box for the alignment but also boxes
      for under/overlays.</p></li>
  <li><p>A third effort concentrated on performance and removed all foocanvas items for
      features, foocanvas items representing columns were retained but nothing below
      that. This has terrific performance advantages but the disadvantage that now
      zmap code had to handle all drawing of graphics primitives, placement within
      columns, detecting mouse clicks on features and so on. And...of course this
      has complicated the code substantially...but the performance is much better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We have reached the stage where drawing in zmap once again needs attention, in particular
the following issues need to be addressed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Performance - </b>we are not using the graphics potential of current hardware.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Drawing Model - </b>Currently all viewable features are loaded in one go allowing rapid
      scrolling over that fixed range but we need to change to continuous loading of features allowing
      zmap to scroll over whole chromosomes.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Vertical/Horizontal - </b>Acedb had vertical tracks which maximised the number of tracks
      that could be displayed but all other modern browsers show tracks horizontally which provides
      more sequence but fewer tracks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes the issues, approach and effort required to reimplement zmap drawing.</p>


<a name="perfect"></a>
<h2>The Perfect Feature Display</h2>

<p>With repetition comes knowledge, or something like that. If we are to change
the zmap display then we should start with a list of features that the new code
must have in order to make the effort worthwhile.</p>


<h3>Track Orientation</h3>

<p>The new display needs a button that will toggle vertical/horizontal display
with minimal disturbance to the user (i.e. they should remain centered on the
position/track that was displayed before they changed orientation).</p>

<p>The importance of this cannot be overestimated, this is almost always the
main criticism of zmap: "ugh, why is it vertical".</p>


<h3>Multiple Windows</h3>

<p>One of ZMap's great selling points was the ability to split the feature view
an arbitrary number of times and to have different sequences in different
windows and to split those windows and so on. No browser-based or indeed java-based
stand alone program has replicated this and yet it's a great feature for the
annotators.<p>


<h3>Unlimited Scrolling</h3>

<p>It is now common to offer this but zmap does not and this needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Zmap should be loading new features as the user scrolls and dumping those features
left behind by the scrolling.</p>

<p>Within the possible frameworks set out below for the drawing model, this should not
be a problem, since fetch requests are then delegated to the data model and the GUI
front end and drawing code should know nothing about it.

<p>However at the moment I am thinking of two levels of data buffering. The first 
is associated with a particular view and is the subset of features from the data 
model that the view will attempt to draw.  This is the subset that gets changed as
we perform most scrolling or zooming operations.

<p>The second is the data model itself 
in the sense that whether automatically or user driven the data model should
be able to request more features from the sources (databases, whatever) to 
which the system is connected. 



<h3>Zooming</h3>

<p>ZMap's zooming was always good but clunky once the maximum X Windows limit had
been reached because further scrolling was more and more limited in scope in order
to avoid exceeding the maximum window size.</p>

<p>Scrolling on demand would fix this by having a fixed window size.</p>

<p>Semantic zooming whereby the way in which features are displayed can change 
as the scale of the view changes. Particularly important if ZMap is to support 
annotation/curation of much larger sequence regions than currently handled.   </p>

<p> Another possibility that might also make drawing and scrolling about the space 
more efficient is to have some kind of semantically defined drawing of features. 
For example, while scrolling, only draw feature outlines, or only draw the start and 
end exons of transcripts. Once the scroll movement has finished, then draw everything 
completely. 

<h3>User Configurability</h3>

<p>User adjustment of display features such as colour, bumping modes, track width, 
track ordering, histogram and graph ranges,
background colours, and many other things should be allowed. And also controllable 
to prevent such if necessary. As much of this as possible should be made dynamically 
controllable.</p>

<h3>Revcomp</h3>

<p>Do we really need this? If so, some thought needs to go into what it means, e.g 
coordinates and their meanings, is revcomp a property of the view or the underlying 
data model? </p>

<h2>Other Requirements</h2>

<h3>Platform Independence</h3>

<p>It is desirable to be able to do native builds on Linux, MacOS and Windows at least.
 Appropriate choices of libraries and toolkits at an early stage will bring this goal 
closer with no extra effort </p>

<h3>Future Proofing</h3>

<p>Poor choices of libraries and toolkits can lead to dependence not only on particular
operating systems but also on out-of-date and unmaintained (and indeed unmaintainable) 
tools such as the foocanvas. This must be avoided in order not to waste time in the future 
and make sure that we can take advantage of improvments in technology such as hardware 
acceleration.

<h3>Use of Standards</h3>

<p>Standards should be used where possible. This includes not only language standards such 
as the STL and boost but other efforts such as formal design methodologies (documented patterns) 
and drawing standards such as OpenGL.


<a name="implementation"></a>
<h2>Implementation Issues</h2>

<h3>Coordinate transforms</h3>

<p>ZMap was bedevilled by problems in this area, there was code all over the place
doing essentially the same things but differently. In defence of zmap the foocanvas
had a severe shortcoming: it could not deal with the situation where it's scrolled
window exceeded the X Window maximum of 32k pixels (or least 32k that you could draw
in to). This made going from feature space to window space <b>hard</b>.</p>


<h3>Model-View-Controller</h3>

<p>Whether you subscribe to MVC or MVP, ZMap's model became screwed up a long time
ago. This was largely the result of trying to accomodate rapidly changing requirements
without thinking things through more carefully. It has however made much of the code
harder to work on that it should have been.</p>

<p>On the face of it MVC/MVP should be relatively easy but in the case of zmap
there are requirements such as multiple windows on to the same sequence or
multiple windows onto different sequences that do it this area more complex.<p>

<p>Fortunately it is relatively simple (with approprite choices of libraries)
to ensure that the object model for the 
program as a whole and any display components can be kept separate from the drawing 
model itself. 


<h3>The Drawing Model</h3>

<p>There are several candidates for how drawing might work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simply draw feature data directly into a window, the only
      coordinate transform would be sequence/track coordinates to window
      coordinates. This has the advantage of simplicity but the disadvantage
      that drawing would need to be really fast to make scrolling possible.</li>
  <li>Draw features into buffers of some description from where the data would
      be moved into the window. Buffering would allow fetching data ahead and so
      avoiding delays but this would make the design significantly more complicated.</li>
  <li>Buffering of feature data. This does not refer to drawing buffers as such 
      (although could) but 
      a subset of the overall set of features that are in or just outside of the 
      sequence/track area represented by the viewport. As the viewport is moved,
      features are added to the subset at one end, and removed from the other. Or 
      added/removed from both ends at the same time in the case of zooming.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other drawing issues to take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We should use tools that allow us to take advantage of hardware acceleration 
      where possible.</li>
  <li>We must maintain separation of the widget set from the drawing code per se. 
       There are many widget sets that provide native drawing capabilities, but 
       these should be avoided in order to clearly deliniate the user interaction
       and display components and the drawing code itself. This will allow future 
       changes to one or the other to be done independently.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Static vs. Dynamic Linking</h3>

Some libraries (e.g. Qt) come with their own build/make facilities which have to be used.
It is inevitable that attempting to integrate something like this with the ZMap build system
would be problematic, so perhaps we should consider building components separately e.g GUI, 
data processing, communications layers, etc. 

Although static linking is possible with most libraries there is a strong preference  
amongst development projects (and commercial providers of course) for things to 
be dynamic. Binary redistribution is not a problem.
This is the default for almost everything and it is not always obvious 
or easy to make the change to static linking. Despite the advantages from the point 
of view of installation and distribution, it might be a good idea to consider making
this change at some point before we are forced to do so.



<h3>Choice of Libraries/Toolkits</h3>

<p>To satisfy all of the above criteria I suggest the most important priorities for the 
decision as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speed/hardware acceleration.</li>
  <li>Future proofing/support of open source projects. </li>
  <li>Decoupling widgets from drawing.  </li>
  <li>Portability. Linux, windows, macos. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a few initial candidates and assessment 
of advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<ul>

  <li>GTK+3 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK%2B) 
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Better the devil you know
      <li> C or C++ binding
      <li> Supports OpenGL
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Might be as unpredictably buggy as v2.*
      <li> Requires GLib
    </ul>
  </li> 
 
<p>
  <li>Qt (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28software%29) 
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Probably the best product (e.g. google earth uses this)
      <li> C++
      <li> Supports OpenGL
      <li> Very very comprehensive (i.e. complicated)
    </ul>
    <p> Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Very very comprehensive (i.e. complicated)
      <li> Enormous libraries
      <li> Have to use their make facility (qmake)
    </ul>
  </li>  

<p>
  <li>FLTK (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLTK)
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Lightweight and simple
      <li> C++
      <li> Supports OpenGL
    </ul>
    <p> Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Less variety of functionality than others
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>



<h3>A Proposed Experiment</h3>

<p>To test these ideas, I suggest an experiment something like the following:  

<p>We are interested in performance of drawing a large number of objects (e.g 10^6) 
defined in some 
world coordinate space, call this [X_s, X_e] by [Y_s, Y_e]. (Subscripts meaning 'start'
and 'end' here.) Our viewport (the bit that's visible on the screen) is only going to 
be a very small portion of the world space (although eventually will be zoomable from 
all the way in and out). Viewport size of about 100-th of the total world space seems 
a reasonable place to start.  I am not going to worry too much about coordinate mappings 
at the moment, since that's not the focus of this experiment.

<p>Let the viewport have the size X_v by Y_v.  This is in 
units of screen pixels. Let the region of the world space that this maps into be
defined by [x_s,x_e] and [y_s,y_e].

<p>What do we want to see in the initial test?
<ul>
  <li> Good performance "scrolling" around this space.
  <li> Zoomability all the way in and out.
</ul>
What does "scrolling" mean in this context? Simply moving the viewport around the 
world space, not necessarily (although it could be) in the sense of a scrolled 
window widget.  

Some possible programming approaches to this are:
<ul>
  <li> Have a large drawing area to accomodate the whole of the world space 
       and place this into a scrolled window. This will
       obviously get very bad very quickly.
  <li> Have a drawing widget in a scrolled window, but where the widget is defined to
       be (say) three times the size of the visible region in the world space and 
       only redraw it when the user's scrolling gets within some tolerance of the 
       edge. This is conceptually what we currently do.
  <li> Draw into the widget taking into account the viewport-to-world transformation 
       ourselves. Calls to draw all of the objects in the world space will then be made and
       we allow the library to take care of clipping objects outside of the visible region.
  <li> As previous, but only make calls to draw a subset of the features in the immediate 
       vicinity of the visible region. This will require maintaining a buffered subset of
       features to be drawn that is updated as one moves the visible region around. For
       example as we scroll to the right, features are added to the end of the list, and 
       removed from the beginning. This approach relies on maintaining lists of features 
       sorted according to their positions in the world space.
</ul>
There are other possibilties; for example, a combination of the buffered feature subset 
with the drawing widget and scrolled window. But the simplest ones are the place to start. 
I think it should be fairly straightfoward to try out some of these possibilities with
the widget sets specified above and initially with the OpenGL interface.
