A collection of talks on zmap.



Note that Tuesday talks to informatics should go into DocRep.

Go to 

http://intweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/utils/docrep/Sanger/Informatics/GroupMeetings/

and follow the instructions. In particular follow the naming convention...

e.g. I put in my talk called "Acedb_ZMap.ppt" as "2004_04_16_Griffiths.ppt" because
that was the day I did the talk.
