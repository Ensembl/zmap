============================
Things to point out in zmap:
============================


Screen areas
------------

- Screen areas of zmap, modelled loosely on a browser:

  menu bar

  action buttons/information area

  display area

- tooltips where appropriate

- buttons that have menus (zoom, dna)

- buttons are inactive when they can't be used

- view is fmap like, forward strand on right, reverse on left, yellow strand separator

- scale remains visible

- usual scroll bars



Zooming/scrolling
-----------------

- zoom 2x in/out or choose from menu

- bottom/right scroll bars should give instaneous scrolling

- go far enough and a second scroll bar appears on left, happens when window
  exceeds X Windows upper limit. Scroll bar represents extent of section that
  can be scrolled instaneously, move this to shift this section.



Splitting
---------

- can split an aribtrary number of times

- horizontal windows are locked horizontally by default

- vertical windows are locked vertically by default

- can unlock at any time

- active window has highlighted border



Selecting features/columns
--------------------------

- Clicking on a feature shows its details (with tooltips)

- Clicking on a column shows its name

- Double clicking a feature results in:

	 an otterlace edit window if the feature is edittable

	 otherwise a simple zmap feature display window


Menu
----

- right click on a column or a feature

- menus are context sensitive

- should be most of the useful functions (e.g. blixem) but some new ones:

	 smart bumping (default) is a combination of cluster and overlap with
	 high to low scoring going left to right.

         Several other bumping options avaiable.

	 Column configuration allows interactive switching off of all columns
	 (and in future will allow setting of column style (colour etc).

	 List all features: gives a popup window listing all features in that
	 column, can sort by position etc. Click on one to see it in the zmap.

	 Search window: allows searching for single or sets of features using
	 various criteria (see below for more info.).



Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

shift-leftbut: shows horizontal ruler + position

Cntl-W: close window
Cntl-Q: quit zmap


More to come....but we need your comments !



Search Window
-------------

- Something that was not easy in xace/fmap was searching and finding features
displayed in fmap. You can use the search window to look for a single feature
or find subsets of features. The result is a list window where you can click
on features and zmap will scroll to and highlight that feature/column.

- all names can be wild carded to find subsets

- additional filters can be applied for strand, position, locus, style (= method).



Menubar operations
------------------

- File

  New...don't use this ! its for choosing new sequences and otterlace will do this.

  Export...doesn't work currently

  Print sends a postscript file of the zmap to the printer. 

  Dump allows you to dump the zmap window to a file in various formats and sizes.


- Edit

  Cut/Copy/Paste...not needed for otterlace

  Redraw, sometimes the foocanvas doesn't quite draw everything correctly, this
     option usually corrects it.


- Help

  The "About" button tells you which version of zmap you are using.
