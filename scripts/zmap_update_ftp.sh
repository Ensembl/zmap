# A script to load the distro tar files to the Sanger ftp site and also update the links on the zmap web page
# Derived from the Seqtools update_website.sh writtem by Gemma Barson
# recent bugs added by mh17
# I removed a few things like 'copy release notes and documentation'
# please refer to the original script for inspiration
#
# NOTE variously we use:
# home dir for build checkout and scripts and git version	home/ZMap
# svn dir for web html		   home/zmap_web
# build dir to get the tarballs  /nfs/zmap/somewhere via a symlink from zmap home
# ftp root	to upload the tarballs
#
#
# NOTE original comment from seqtools
# This script updates the external Sanger website, FTP site and intranet
# with details of the latest overnight, development or production build (as
# specified by the given type and build directory). It:
#  * copies the distribution tarball into the relevant directory on the FTP site;
#  * updates the external website with a link to the new build on the FTP site;
#  * copies the user manuals into the Docs directory on the FTP site (production build only);
#  * copies the source-code documentation to the intranet (overnight build only).
#
#                        **WARNING**
# If you alter this script you should be aware that it is called as
# a cron job on tviewsrv from the zmap userid to update the OVERNIGHT
# copy of the SeqTools install stuff on the website, FTP site and intranet.
