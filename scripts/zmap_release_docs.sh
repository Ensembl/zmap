# ================= README ==================

# Script to make all the documentation and update the website with it.
# Really just  a convenience  script which runs  the scripts  that the
# build does  in the right order  at the right  time, without emailing
# errors or complaining too much.

# Things to note.

# Any passwords requested will be USER=zmap passwords

# Make sure all the doc you want to release is cvs committed first.

# Doxygen produces a lot of messages while it's working.

# ================== CONFIG ================== 
# Configuration variables

# ENSURE_UP_TO_DATE= cvs update the directory where scripts are [ yes | no ]
ENSURE_UP_TO_DATE=yes
# Or for development, uncomment this
#ENSURE_UP_TO_DATE=no
