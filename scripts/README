This directory contains scripts used to build and test zmap.

The scripts can be run by hand but are also run from a crontab so be careful
when changing them !

If you add scripts to this directory then here are some points to note:

1) scripts must either be perl or bash, i.e. not sh, csh, awk or ksh.

2) If you write a bash script then you should make use of the general
functions in the ZBfunctions script file. Look in one of the other bash
scripts for how to call this at the start of your script. If you come up with
a useful general function then add it to ZBfunctions.

3) The scripts get copied to ~acedb/ZMap/prefix/scripts which the zmap
developers and the acedb userid have on their path. While this is where your
script will be found, you should not assume that this is where your script
will be running from.
