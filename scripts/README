This directory contains scripts used to build and test zmap.

The scripts can be run by hand but are also run from a crontab so be careful
when changing them !

If you add scripts to this directory then here are some points to note:

1) scripts must either be perl or bash, i.e. not sh, csh, awk or ksh.

2) If you write a bash script then you should make use of the general
functions in the ZBfunctions script file. Look in one of the other bash
scripts for how to call this at the start of your script. If you come up with
a useful general function then add it to ZBfunctions.

3) The scripts get copied to ~zmap/prefix/scripts which the zmap
developers and the zmap userid have on their path. While this is where your
script will be found, you should not assume that this is where your script
will be running from.



How to build a new release
==========================

Each time we build a new release of zmap we tag the release so we can recreate
the code from cvs at any time. We also update the version number held in the
code itself so that all the next development session takes place with this
new code version number for bug reporting etc.

Currently this is what you need to do to make such a release...


As user "zmap":


> zmapbootstrap

> zmapbuild -v  -u -I  -m deskpro16113 MYTEST >BUILDS/MYTEST.LOG 2>&1


(currently zmapbootstrap does not pass args through to zmapbuild correctly otherwise
you could just do this:

> zmapbootstrap -c "zmapbuild -v  -u -I  -m deskpro16113 MYTEST" >BUILDS/MYTEST.LOG 2>&1

)




The versioner script
====================

Roy wrote the versioner script which is used to do all sorts of version like stuff...


# here's how to get the version number for setting up a directory name...this is already
# in the script....
deskpro16113[edgrif]54: versioner -path $HOME/ZMap/ZMap/src/include/ZMap/ -show -V -quiet
0-1-3

# heres how to get the tag....
deskpro16113[edgrif]55: versioner -path $HOME/ZMap/ZMap/src/include/ZMap/ -show  -quiet
RELEASE_0-1-3


the script can also tag the whole of cvs...
