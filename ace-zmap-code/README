This directory contains code that was originally written by Simon Kelley to implement
a zmap running under xace.

Rob Clack then took this code and tried to change it to have genuinely acedb/non-acedb
parts, this was not a success and was abandonned.

The code is here just so that is does not get lost, that's all.
