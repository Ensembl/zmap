Building GTK+v2
---------------

Building GTK+v2 can be a little painful sometimes.  Most notably on
Mac OS X.  It's quite easy to get conflicts between libraries, mess up
the machine and generally give yourself a small headache.  This
directory contains a few scripts and pointers to help.

build.sh           - the main script
build_config.sh    - configuration
build_functions.sh - functions to help build.sh

additionally the following will be auto generated during build.sh runs

build.exe.config.sh - saved configuration
build_status.sh     - which packages have been installed


Running
-------

Make sure you are happy with the configuration (see altering
configuration below) and run build.sh. To quickly change configuration
of one or more of the variables run:

./build.sh SLEEP=0 PREFIX=/tmp CLEAN_BUILD_DIR=yes


Altering Configuration
----------------------

Basic - Just edit the variables in build_config.sh. Convention on
boolean variables is "yes" = truth, "no" = falsehood

New Pacakges - To add extra packages use the current pacakages as
examples and note the comments...


It all fails
------------

Hopefully there should be some helpful messages as to where it's
failed.  If its a build error, does the patch file need changing?  For
each package there are two files which help with this in the patches
directory.  The files have the naming scheme <package>-<version>.sh and 
<package>-<version>.patch.  The patch file is run first:

cd <base>/<build>/<package>-<version>/
patch -p0 -u < <base>/patches/<package>-<version>.patch

Following on from this the shell script is run.

<package>-<version>.sh <base> <package>-<version>
So $1 will be <base> and $2 <package>-<version>


Notes
-----

libjpeg appears sensitive to being reconfigure'd a make distclean will cure it.
This can be achieved by setting CLEAN_PACKAGE_DIR=yes

gettext sometimes complains about one of the following

- sed is not GNU sed
- No AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
- some other automake/configure error

It seems to be sensitive  to being built multiple times with different
configure  options.  If  you get  these errors  try an  rm -rf  on the
gettext directory
