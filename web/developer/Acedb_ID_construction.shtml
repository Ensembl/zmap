<H2>ZMap: Constructing Unique IDs from Acedb Feature Data</H2>


<br/>
<fieldset>
<legend id="Background">Background</legend>

<p>ZMap displays large numbers of features which may potentially come from several different
sources. All of these features must be uniquely displayed and while most of these features
will never be modified by the user they must still be uniquely identified for
operations such as selection and searching. This document describes a proposal for
how to uniquely identify all the features exported from an acedb database.</p>

<p>The proposal must take into account efficiency in terms of memory usage and feature
look up because the number of some features can be very large.</p>

</fieldset>



<br/>
<fieldset>
<legend id="Acedb_Uniqueness">Acedb Uniqueness</legend>


<p>Uniqueness in acedb occurs at various levels:</p>

<ul>
    <li>In the model:
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Class:</b> Class names must be unique in a models file
	  <li><b>Tag:</b> Tag names must be unique within a class definition
	</ul>
    <li>In the data:
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Object level:</b> Object names must be unique within a class
	  <li><b>Data field level:</b> Values must be unique for any one data field
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>At first glance this seems a simple scheme but it can be used to represent features that
have small or even essentially no differences, e.g. given the following models file:</p>

<pre>
?Sequence DNA UNIQUE ?DNA UNIQUE Int

?Homol_A 
	  Homol	DNA_homol ?Sequence ?Method Float Int Int Int Int

?Homol_B
	  Homol	DNA_homol ?Sequence ?Method Float Int Int Int Int
</pre>


<p>then this is perfectly legal:</p>

<pre>
Homol_A: "try this"
DNA_homol "sequence_A" "My_method" 0.1 1000 1500 1 501

Homol_B: "try this"
DNA_homol "sequence_A" "My_method" 0.1 1000 1500 1 501
</pre>


<p>which interestingly would produce this GFF from Acedb:</p>

<pre>
XXXXX   My_method       similarity      1000    1500    0.1     +       .       Target "Sequence:sequence_A" 1 501

XXXXX   My_method       similarity      1000    1500    0.1     +       .       Target "Sequence:sequence_A" 1 501
</pre>

<p>In the GFF the uniqueness has been lost because the enclosing object Class-objectname tuple has been lost.
The proposal must be able to distinguish these as different features so must include the Class-objectname
as additional tag/value fields in the exported GFF to distinguish these features.</p>

</fieldset>



<br/>
<fieldset>
<legend id="Encoding_uniqueness">Encoding Acedb's Uniqueness</legend>


<p>Some features are represented in the database by an object (e.g. a transcript) while
other features are represented by sets of tags/data within an Acedb
object. Of these latter features, some will specify features that map to just one
position (e.g. an allele) while others specify features that map to many positions (e.g. homologies).
Uniqueness must be guaranteed for all of these.</p>


<p>The types of feature that must be represented include three main variants:</p>


<pre>
Feature object:

?Sequence 
	  Structure  From	Source UNIQUE ?Sequence  // start/end given in parent ?Sequence object.
          Method ?Method

Simple features within an object:

?Sequence
	  Feature ?Method Int Int UNIQUE Float UNIQUE Text


Alignment features within an object:

?Sequence
	  Homol	DNA_homol ?Sequence XREF DNA_homol ?Method Float Int Int Int Int
</pre>

<p>An initial representation of the most complex (alignment) type of feature would be:

<pre>
Model:

?Sequence
          Homol DNA_homol ?Sequence XREF DNA_homol ?Method Float Int Int Int Int


Data:

Sequence : "my_sequence"
DNA_homol "some_sequence" "some_method" 0.994 10000 10500 1 501          


Unique id:


"Sequence" + "my_sequence" + "DNA_homol" + "some_method" + "0.994" + "10000" + "10500" + "1" + "501"
</pre>

<p>This representation would require around 60 bytes <b>per</b> homology feature just for the id,
substantial memory can be saved however:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firstly, in all cases the method can be removed as this is the key for the
      containing feature set for that feature and hence does not need to be part of the id.
  <li>Secondly, several of the qualifiers that make the entire feature description unique are
      often constant from one feature to the next so these can be stored just once rather than for every
      feature.
</ul>

<p>For each feature the id will be split into two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <font color=green>Constant</font> parts which do not contain position or score
  <li>The <font color=red>Variable</font> parts consisting of position and score
      which will change with every feature
</ol>


<p>Some examples (constant part is given in <font color=green>green</font> and the
variable part in <font color=red>red</font>):</p>

<pre>
Object:

Sequence : "A_sequence"
Source "parent_sequence"         // parent object gives start/end as 15000 15250


IDs:

<font color=green>"Sequence" + "A_sequence"</font>
<font color=red>15000 + 15250</font>
</pre>

<pre>
Simple feature within an object:

Sequence : "simple_features"
Feature "some_method" 1500 10000 0.997


IDs:

<font color=green>"Sequence" + "simple_features" + "Feature"</font>
<font color=red>15000 + 15250 + 0.997</font>
</pre>


<pre>
Alignment feature within an object:

Sequence : "xref_feature"
DNA_homol "some_sequence" "some_method" 0.997 15000 15500 1 501


IDs:

<font color=green>"Sequence" + "xref_feature" + "DNA_homol" + "some_sequence"</font>
<font color=red>0.997 15000 15500 1 501</font>
</pre>


<p>To give an example the operations to construct the two part id for an alignment feature would be:</p>

<pre>
Sequence : "xref_feature"
DNA_homol "some_sequence" "some_method" 0.997 15000 15500 1 501

1) Concatenate <font color=green>"Sequence" + "xref_feature" + "DNA_homol" + "some_sequence"</font>
and hash the resulting string into an ID which will be shared between a number of alignments.

2) Concatenate <font color=red>0.997 15000 15500 1 501</font> <b>directly</b> (i.e. do not convert to
text representation) into a 21 byte string (5 * 4 + terminating NULL) and hash the resulting string
into an ID which is unique to this alignment.
</pre>

<p>This scheme has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current scheme does not guarantee uniqueness and if extended to do so would consume
      large amounts of memory as each feature would require all parts of the qualifier.
  <li>For all features where the constant part can be shared then that will be a significant memory
      saving.
  <li>Encoding the position information directly will probably save overall as so much positional
      and score information requires at least 4 digits.
</ul>


<p>Disadvantages are:</p>

<p>All features will need a new 4 byte field to hold the position ID:</p>

<pre>
typedef struct ZMapFeatureAnyStruct_
{
  ZMapFeatureStructType struct_type ;			    /* context or align or block etc. */
  ZMapFeatureAny parent ;				    /* The parent struct of this one, NULL
							     * if this is a feature context. */
  GQuark unique_id ;					    /* Unique id of this feature. */
  GQuark original_id ;					    /* Original id of this feature. */
  <font color=red>GQuark position_id ;					    /* New variable/position ID. */</font>

  GHashTable *children ;				    /* Child objects, e.g. aligns, blocks etc. */
} ZMapFeatureAnyStruct ;
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b> that construction of the position_id requires that one of the score or positions are
zero.</p>



<p>The tree of hash tables used for searching for features will require another level
of hash to give the <font color=green>Constant</font> followed by
<font color=red>Variable</font> search for ids:</p>

<pre>
Previously:

context -> alignment(s) -> block(s) -> featureset(s) -> feature


Under new scheme:

context -> alignment(s) -> block(s) -> featureset(s) -> <font color=green>Constant</font> -> <font color=red>Variable</font>
</pre>

<legend id="Tag_sets">Summary of Acedb Tag Sets that need to be Encoded</legend>

<p>Where the feature is an acedb object the encoding will always be the same,
the Class and object name and it's start and end. Where the feature is a subpart
of an object the encoding is more complex and the following
is a list of known tag sets with examples:</p>

<pre>
Pattern:          Tag Int Int
Encoding:         <font color=green>"obj class" + "obj name" + "Tag"</font>
                  <font color=red>Int + Int</font>

Examples:	  Splices Confirmed_intron  Int Int #Splice_confirmation



Pattern:          Tag ?Method Int Int Float
Encoding:         <font color=green>"obj class" + "obj name" + "Tag"</font>
                  <font color=red>Int + Int + Float</font>

Examples:         Splices Predicted_5 ?Method Int Int UNIQUE Float
                          Predicted_3 ?Method Int Int UNIQUE Float

                  EMBL_feature  CAAT_signal	Int Int Text #EMBL_info
			        GC_signal	Int Int Text #EMBL_info
			        TATA_signal	Int Int Text #EMBL_info
                                etc....

                  Feature ?Method Int Int UNIQUE Float UNIQUE Text #Feature_info


Pattern:          Tag xref_obj Int Int
Encoding:         <font color=green>"obj class" + "obj name" + "Tag" + "xref obj name"</font>
                  <font color=red>Int + Int</font>

Examples:	  Oligo ?Oligo XREF In_sequence Int UNIQUE Int
                  Allele ?Allele XREF Sequence UNIQUE Int UNIQUE Int UNIQUE Text


Pattern:          Tag xref_obj ?Method Float Int Int Int Int
Encoding:         <font color=green>"obj class" + "obj name" + "Tag" + "xref obj name"</font>
                  <font color=red>Float + Int + Int + Int + Int</font>

Examples:	  Homol	DNA_homol ?Sequence XREF DNA_homol ?Method Float Int Int Int Int #Homol_info
		        Pep_homol ?Protein XREF DNA_homol ?Method Float Int Int Int Int #Homol_info
