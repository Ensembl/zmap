The merge is not as simple as I thought, need to either copy everything that is to be merged
(seems wasteful) or we need to NULL out/remove the things we have transferred....perhaps not
so hard....

Main thing is to protect whole GDatas that we move into our new sets and null out ones we
don't want. But also, what happens to datastructs of features that we have allocated but
no longer need...they should be freed....

Sounds like merge needs to be in some separate feature code package....

It can be done but needs thought..........

Currently we just don't free the stuff...and we should leave it like this for ISMB.

This must be sorted out afterwards otherwise it will use up a lot of memory.
