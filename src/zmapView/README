ZMapView


This directory contains the code that controls an instance of a "ZMapView".
A ZMapView is created when a sequence is to be displayed and it includes one or
more windows (not top level) that show the same or different views of a set of
data and one or more server connections to get the data.

This code is the interface by which the fetching/viewing of a single set of
data is controlled, it is not an executable or a top level window in its own
right but must be linked in with other code that makes calls to this code.
