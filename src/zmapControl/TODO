ZMapControl


The title bar should be updated when we first connect now as the sequence name
is known then....



The pane stuff needs some attention, particularly in the area of setting focus
because focus setting includes lots of different operations like setting the
window title, the navigator etc.....


The window title needs to be updated to the sequence for the new view each time focus
is changed........

When you split the display into several panes and then close them all down again leaving one,
extra frames are being left, so the remaining window has several thin dark lines surrounding
it instead of just one.  Clearly the close function is not destroying all the frames that are
created during the split.  I'm leaving this as we don't think the users will do this too often
and it doesn't seem to break anything, but it does suggest the split/close processing is not 
entirely under control.




XREMOTE:  code should be moved out of acedb tree into a new directory and it should
have a separate header that defines the atoms used. Apps can then use this to include
and respond to commands etc.
