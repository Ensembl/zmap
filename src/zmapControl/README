ZMapControl


This directory contains the code that controls an instance of a "ZMap". A
ZMap is created when a sequence is to be displayed and it includes not only
the ZMap window but also the code to monitor that window and to create and
control threads to retrieve and convert data from servers.

This code is the interface by which a ZMap is controlled, it is not an executable
in its own right but must be linked in with other code that makes calls to
this code.
