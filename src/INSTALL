Install notes for ZMap.


- zmap uses gmake on all platforms, it requires certain macros, e.g. VPATH
that gmake supports. On linux "make" is gmake, on the Alpha you must
explicitly say "gmake".

- you must run "make depend" before you run the first make. We don't do this
by default because it would be run nearly all the time and this would be
irritating.
