ZMapGFF


This directory contains the code that parses GFF lines and constructs ZMapFeature's
from the lines. The intention is that the code will eventually parse either GFF
v2 or v3. Currently the code only does v2 as this is the supported version of
GFF and v3 format is still in the melting pot.

The GFF parser needs to handed lines to parse, it deliberately does not deal with
issues of data sources, this is so that is can be coupled to any source and large
GFF documents can be parsed a line at a time.
