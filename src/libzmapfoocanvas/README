ZMap Foocanvas


We hereby acknowledge that the zmap foocanvas version was derived directly
from the gnome foo canvas. Please see the copyright notice and other
information in the ZMap/foocanvas directory which gives full credit to and
details the authors of the original foocanvas.


This directory contains the source code for the zmap version of the foocanvas.
The code is copied directly from ZMap/foocanvas/tmp_merged_foocanvas which is
a merged version of the latest foocanvas and our modifications to the
foocanvas contained in ZMap/foocanvas/zmap_source. The code in this directory
is NOT in CVS, the cvs copy is in ZMap/foocanvas/zmap_source, please follow
the instructions in ZMap/foocanvas/foocanvas_build.html which shows how to
make these source files.


These files are now part of the build process for ZMap and are compiled into
an archive of .o files which is used to directly build the zmap executable. We
no longer require the configure and other steps to build a separately
installed foocanvas library.
