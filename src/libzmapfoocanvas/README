Welcome to the FooCanvas.

FooCanvas is a version of the Gnome Canvas that has removed several
features in order to create a small, useful, working, maintainable
canvas. The redraw mechanisms have also been changed so that it now
works like any other Gtk+ 2 widget, using double buffering, idle
redraw and 32bit window coordinates. I've also added some new
functions and features.

Missing features are: antialiased mode, affines, microtiles and
GnomeCanvasShape. In order to remove GnomeCanvasShape, several items
have been backed down to the version before they were shape:ized.

The name FooCanvas is temporary, while i ponder what is a good final
place and name for this library.

The idea is to have a nice canvas for simple users that are not using
the advanced (and somewhat broken) features of the full gnome canvas.

Intended target audience is e.g. the bar-charts in memprof, the icon
view in nautilus, gnumeric, the canvas usage in the RH installer,
gantt charts in MrProject, calendar in Evolution, icon-selectors,
fileselectors etc.

This is NOT meant to be used by heavy-duty graphics intensive apps
like gill and sodipodi. They are better off using the regular gnome
canvas or some app-specific solution.
