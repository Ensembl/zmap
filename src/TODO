logging...

if you let glib log routines output the message you get something like:

process:554514): ZMap-WARNING **: (zmapAppwindow.c, line 103) - try this for size...
==================================

the underlined bit if supplied by glib, BUT it does not do this if you use your
own logging routine which is a bit irritating....

There also seems to be bug in that glib seems to be messing about with fileptrs and hanging
on to them so that printf statements either don't appear at all or appear in the logfile
sometimes.....





COORDINATES...

By the time we get into the drawing code all features should be as  start,end where
start <= end ALWAYS !  Any conversions should be done by the thread code on the basis
of information from the servers...
