STUFF THAT NEEDS DOING

Please add new stuff as required _and_ remove obsolete or completed items !

Everything should be under some kind of more general heading.



CANVAS
------

The scale is not good, the units seem utterly bizarre as you zoom in.


The navigator needs to change as the focus changes and the buttons needs
to change their sensitivity.


when you click on a feature in the window that shows the list of features,
  the position scroll bar is not updated properly...needs the visibility
  change callback to be called.





LOGGING
-------

if you let glib log routines output the message you get something like:

process:554514): ZMap-WARNING **: (zmapAppwindow.c, line 103) - try this for size...
==================================

the underlined bit if supplied by glib, BUT it does not do this if you use your
own logging routine which is a bit irritating....

There also seems to be bug in that glib seems to be messing about with fileptrs and hanging
on to them so that printf statements either don't appear at all or appear in the logfile
sometimes.....





COORDINATES
-----------
By the time we get into the drawing code all features should be as  start,end where
start <= end ALWAYS !  Any conversions should be done by the thread code on the basis
of information from the servers...








SERVER
------

MY HEADER FILES ARE A BIT MIXED UP....I NEED THIS STRUCTURE:



      zmapView  <---> new server cmds header          <---> cleaned up zmapConn.h
                      with structs from zmapServer.h        that deals only with thread interface


      (contd) <--->  zmapSlave code  <--->  new server cmds header       <---> zmapServer.h minus
                                          with structs from zmapServer.h       the cmds header stuff


The slave should not know about what is in the server command, the server code should
disentangle that and call the serverprototype stuff....
