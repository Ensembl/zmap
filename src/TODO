[Produce better Autoconf]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = Having moved to an autoconf/make etc. can we improve?


[focus window red border]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = Currently canvas windows are surrounded by a frame, while this can be \
coloured red it cannot be made wider and so is almost invisible.

[document rationalisation]
Across = Not_Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = The docs directories need sorting out. We should have a script which ensures \
that the doxygen generated docs end up in the "docs" directory below src. The \
makeQuad files should also end up there so we just have the one docs directory. \


[scale display]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = The scale is not good, the units seem utterly bizarre as you zoom in. \
Also, it needs moving into a separate slidable window like the other locators \
so that it is always visible. It will have to be linked to scrolling in the \
focus canvas.


[DNA display]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Text = Need to add display of DNA, should include highlighting of exons etc. when \
clicked on.


[Focus change]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = The navigator needs to change as the focus changes and the buttons needs \
to change their sensitivity, this is only partially done.


[interaction with features]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = when you click on a feature in the window that shows the list of features, \
the position scroll bar is not updated properly...needs the visibility \
change callback to be called.


[Region/Scroll scrollbars]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = The Region/Scroll scrollbars should be sorted to be the correct width by magic. \
Can we add a double click to hide/show to the vertical line of dots??

[Resize of zmap window that requires canvas size to increase does not work.]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = Resize of window DOES NOT redraw canvas, this should happen.  Also needs to  \
re-enable/disable Zoom In/Out buttons (does redraw already have a hook? to do this?)


[glib logging glitches]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = if you let glib log routines output the message you get something like: \
\
process:554514): ZMap-WARNING **: (zmapAppwindow.c, line 103) - try this for size...\
\
\
the bit upto and including the "**" is supplied by glib, BUT it does not do this if you use your \
own logging routine which is a bit irritating.... \
\
There also seems to be bug in that glib seems to be messing about with fileptrs and hanging \
on to them so that printf statements either don't appear at all or appear in the logfile\
sometimes.....

[multiple alignment support]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Text = In order to support multiple alignments there will have to be changes to all of \
zmapControl, zmapView and zmapWindow, it influences all of them. The changes need \
not be too great if we can substitute a set of alignments for the single alignment \
that View currently represents....But it will make view more complicated probably. \
 \
Currently there is fudged code in zmapWindowDrawFeatures() in zmapWindowDrawFeatures.c \
to allow us to start inserting more than one set of alignment data into a window.


[Getting style information from servers]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = Currently the user has to have a styles file, this is because otherwise we have to query \
the server and get all the types, this code is not impossible but is not written yet. \
It needs doing, BUT, the user should still be able to override this with a list of \
features that they want to see, gives the user control.


[PANGO and FONTS]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = Check requirement of -DPANGO_ENABLE_{BACKEND,ENGINE} also fontconfig, see if we can fix/remove \
"Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file" \
FONTCONFIG_PATH \
FONTCONFIG_FILE 





[ACedb tools: xremote and blixem]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase II
Text = code should be moved out of acedb tree into a new directory and it should \
have a separate header that defines the atoms used. Apps can then use this to include \
and respond to commands etc. The same should be done for a small library to launch blixem \
given a sequence name/sequences.


[GFF stuff]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = Add ability of caller to specify a start/end so this code will filter out anything not in the \
start/end coords. May not be so easy though....what about clipped features...ugh...actually \
its not so simple....bother.....we really want to filter as we process but we won't be able \
to filter some features until we've seen all of them...sigh....yes, its actually quite tricky \
and tedious... \
 \
Need to scope how long it will take to do GFF3.....as this is what we really want....



[file server interface code]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = the code in this directory is crude currently, here are some things that need doing: \
 \
- should be able to read files other than GFF.......this will require some restructuring \
  to provide a general file reading interface with specific parsers (preferably the same \
  ones as are used for GFF, XML etc. etc. \
 \
- error handling is probably less than complete. \
 \
- there is no way to ask for just some features currently but this also applies to the server \
interfaces as well....


[cancel points in THREADs code]
Across = Not_Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text =  need to introduce pthreads_cancel_points into the code so that a cancel \
will interrupt at good places....some thought needed here though to ensure \
that we don't just litter the code with cancel points making it hard to \
maintain...\
\
I think to some extent the main network reading calls get interrupted by \
a cancel so that makes it all work better.


[file utilities in Zmap utils]
Across = Not_Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Text = The fileUtils all need sorting out, they should be rationalised into calls that get \
files from the .ZMap directory and more general calls that construct path names etc.



[zmapfeatures merge]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Text = The merge needs work, currently it leads memory and is probably not as efficient as it \
it should be. We should not copy across data but instead move pointers. \
\
Main thing is to protect whole GDatas that we move into our new sets and null out ones we \
don't want. But also, what happens to datastructs of features that we have allocated but \
no longer need...they should be freed.... \


[zmapwindow resize method]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Text = We _must_ have a resize method so that if the window size gets changes in a way \
that resizes the canvas window then we alter the zoom etc.....


## 20050304 meeting
[zmap dynamic methods]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase I
Text = Need to have the ability to dynamically create/read methods/styles from acedb.

[zmap window id]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase I
Text = xwininfo is the current method and needs to be replaced to allow communication with zmap. \
Same with port and anything else that otter does with xwininfo output.

[zmap configuration file]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase I
Text = The syntax of the properties in the configuration file needs to be constrained/decided \
and coded for, probably to include a uri for data sources.  Will we still need format.  \
The problem I see is file://... With http:// the header would tell us what it is.  However \
with file the extension is probably the best guess we can make.  Does libcurl give us a response \
callback we could check with?

[zmap vs fmap display]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase I
Text = compare and contrast FMap display and ZMap display. Does ZMap look sane? \
Has it drawn all the information?...

[zmap_remote]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase II
Text = support external calls via xremote mechanism, to allow external programs to drive zmap.

[zmap remote sematics]
Across = Important
Down = Urgent
Block = SwapPhase II
Text = what do we need to support. 

[das 1 xml support]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Block = ReplacePhase
Text = Otter wants to get features from ensembl databases.  There are das servers to serve this. \
we should use this to replace the need to download to ace.

[otter xml support]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Block = ReplacePhase
Text = when das 1 works it should be easier to get zmap to understand otter xml

[read features from pipeline database]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Block = ReplacePhase
Text = More replacement of acedb .ace files

[local blast execution]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Block = ReplacePhase
Text = Otter does some local blast searches against a user's database and creates ace files for \
otter/Fmap.  What can we do with regards this?

[editing]
Across = Important
Down = Not_Urgent
Block = editing
Text = decide on editing mechanism. \
Do our own interface... <br/>\
xremote -> DAS2 translation... <br/> \
xremote -> Otter translation..
