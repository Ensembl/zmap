the code in this directory is crude currently, here are some things that need doing:

- should be able to read files other than GFF.......this will require some restructuring
  to provide a general file reading interface with specific parsers (preferably the same
  ones as are used for GFF, XML etc. etc.

- error handling is probably less than complete.

- there is no way to ask for just some features currently but this also applies to the server
interfaces as well....
