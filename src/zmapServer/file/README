there are a few wobbly bits here...the code that reads the server stanzas is in View,
perhaps this is not so good....think about this....we will need to make it read something
like:


{
filename="/my/file/some/where"
}

as though it were a server stanza, we could just specify the protocol as "file"

or perhaps we should make the stanzas be either:

server
{
protocol="acedb" etc.
host="griffin"
port=210000
}

or for a file:

server
{
protocol="file"
filename="/some/where/over/the/rainbow"
}

that is actually on too bad....except that View would have to know all that....better perhaps
to overload "host" or we could change "host" to be "source" and make it a blank delimited string
that contains the host and optionally the port or if the protocol if "file" it can contain the
filename...

a number of options...think about it...
