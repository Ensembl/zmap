Server interface

Code that provides an interface to contacting a server over the network and
asking for and collecting data from the server.

Subdirectories contain any code required for particular servers.



The organisation of the code is:

                                                                         - acedb
                                                                        |
request from GUI  ---> zmapServerProtocolHandler.c ---> zmapServer.c ---|- das
                                                                        |
                                                                         - file
                                                                        |
                                                                         - etc.


zmapServerProtocolHandler functions decode the request and issue the appropriate
zmapServer calls, these calls do any general request handling that is required by
all data sources and then route the request to the appropriate set of functions
for acedb, das or whatever.
