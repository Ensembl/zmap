datastream

The rationale for this code is that previously we were reading GFF data only
and always through a GIOChannel, now we have different data formats and read
them from different streams/files.

Thus the abstraction of ZMapDataStream, which has two types

            ZMapDataStreamGIO       GIOChannel, synchronous OR asynchronous
            ZMapDataStreamHTS       HTS file, synchronous only
