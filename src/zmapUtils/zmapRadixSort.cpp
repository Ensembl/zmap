 * Description: generic radix sort for linked lists keyed by integers
 *
 *-------------------------------------------------------------------
 */


/*
 * (radix sort can be read about on wikipedia)
 * it's linear efficiency and sorts integers digit by digit
 * we use base 256 to represent the integers and store intermediate results in a table of 256 lists
 * 256 is a benign compromise between minimising the number of iterations and memory required
 * and processor architecture (byte addressable)
 * the algorithm is stable and is processed by the least significant digit first
 * to make this generic we require a function that extracts an integer key from an object

 * to combine keys make the array longer and place them in order (least significant first
 * to sort in the reverse direction subtarct the integers from G_MAXUINT
 * if you have range limitations on key data (eg 24 bits not 32) then you can make the keys shorter

 * memory use is light: 1k for 256 32 bit pointers, mutiply that by 2 for tail end list pointers
 * and multiple again by 2 for 64 bit machines, so 4k in total.
 * if constricting a key is time consuming then consider doing it once only, which will use O(n) memory

 * simple tests show this is much slower than merge sort!
 * generating a byte addressable key in the thing object would speed this up probably a lot
 * eg:

 guchar key[sizeof guint) * 2];
 guint *x = (giunt *) &key;
 *x++ = feature->x1;
 *x++ = G_MAXINT - feature->x2;

 run time stats look very flaky
 There's inaccuracies in the timing due to scheduling (results are real time)
 But both merge sort and radix sort operate as worst case == best case
 There has to be a mistake somewhere...
 merge sort should get slower as data increases (it does)
 radix sort should be consistently linear (it's not)

 The theory was that this could be used in column summarise and run faster but it doesn't!
