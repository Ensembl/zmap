 * Description:
 *
 * a simple implementation of a skip list data structure
 * NOTE we expect the lists to be static except exceptionally
 * and the module is designed with this in mind
 * used initially by zmapWindowGraphDensityItem.c

/*
 * NOTE William Pugh's original example code can be found via ftp://ftp.cs.umd.edu/pub/skipLists/
 * but we adopt slightly different approach:
 * - we use forward and backward pointers not just forward
 * - index levels are implemented by list pointers up and down not an array, which means that we
 *   do not concern ourselves with how much data we want to index and data is allocated only when needed
 * - the list layers are explicitly balanced by inserting and deleting nodes
 * - layers are removed when they become empty
 *
 * NOTE initially we do not implement balancing, and stop at the point where
 * the data structure is secure through insert and delete operations
 * actual use is static, and we construct the skip list by lazy evaluation
 * when we delete or addfeatures afterwards we just re-create the skip list as that is safe
 * if you implement list balancing the write a test program to thrash the code
 * as any bugs will be obscure otherwise
 *
 * NOTE later developments have a requirement for efficient delete and add and these include:
 * - expand and contract compressed BAM (1000 features in 60k)
 * - change featureset style - need to remove one set from a column of many and re-insert
 *   possibly in a diff column (if setting stranded)
