 * Description: Rewrite of acedb's "handle" system for freeing loads of
 *              memory with one call.
 *              
 *              NOTE that we cannot simply use the acedb code because we
 *              have lots of memory that is not allocated by us but by
 *              glib.

 * 
 * \brief  Package for freeing sets of memory blocks.
 * 
 * zMapMemoryHandle routines allow the freeing of sets of memory blocks by one application call.
 * Each block can be free'd by a custom routine which can be supplied with user data or by default
 * is freed with a call to g_free().
 * 
 * This package is completely inspired by the Acedb "STORE_HANDLE" package which I think was
 * largely coded by Simon Kelley (srk@sanger.ac.uk). Note that it is a complete rewrite as this
 * package uses glib functions and works in a different way: the caller allocates the memory and
 * passes in a pointer to that memory. This makes the package more flexible in that the memory
 * could have been allocated by any package.
 *
