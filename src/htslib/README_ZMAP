This file is part of the ZMap distribution and not part of the external
library package installed here. It is a decriptive placeholder for our git

htslib is a library supporting reading/writing of common sequence file formats
and in particular BAM, CRAM and VCF. ZMap makes use of this library to read
files suppilied by the user on the command line or via configuration files.

Note that Makefile has been altered to include a distdir target which we need
so that we can make our "dist" file:


# Needed to support making a dist when htslib is included in other packages.
distdir:
	cp -r ./* $(distdir) ;
