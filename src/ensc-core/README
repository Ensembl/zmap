ZMap now has a dependency on the Ensembl C API code in the 'ensc-core' library.

The ZMap build expects to find the ensc-core code/makefiles etc. in this
subdirectory (src/ensc-core). The build will fail unless this is so.

The contents of ensc-core are copied in automatically each time you run autogen.sh.
The code is copied from our local clone on git.internal.sanger.ac.uk. If updates
are required this repository should be updated from the main source code at
https://github.com/Ensembl/ensc-core
