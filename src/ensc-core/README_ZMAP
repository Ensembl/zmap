--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is part of the ZMap distribution and not part of the external
library package installed here. It is a decriptive placeholder for our git
repository.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZMap now has a dependency on the Ensembl C API code in the 'ensc-core' library.

The ZMap build expects to find the gbtools code/makefiles etc, either installed
locally or in the subdirectory src/gbtools. The build will fail unless this is so.

You can either copy the files/subdirectories of ensc-core into src/ensc-core
yourself or you can run ZMap's autogen.sh bootstrap script with the "-e"
flag. The latter will copy our working branch of ensc-core into
src/ensc-core.

Alternatively, if you have a checkout of ensc-core that you have installed
locally then you can point the zmap build to use that by setting these flags
when you call runconfig (this will only work if you have NOT copied ensc-core
into the src subdirectory):
   
   ../../runconfig LDFLAGS="-L<INSTALL_DIR>/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I<INSTALL_DIR>/include


Note that the ensc-core code is copied from our local clone on git.internal.sanger.ac.uk. 
If updates are required this repository should be updated from the main source code at
https://github.com/Ensembl/ensc-core
