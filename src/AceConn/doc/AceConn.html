<H1 align=center>AceConn - a C library for accessing the Acedb Server</H1>

<ADDRESS>Originally written by<BR>
Ed Griffiths &lt;edgrif@sanger.ac.uk&gt;, March 2002</ADDRESS>
</DIV>

<!-- ************************************************************* -->
<H2>Background</H2>

<P>The introduction of a sockets based server for Acedb has allowed perl, python
and java based clients easy access to the server as these languages already
provide good packages for using sockets. The AceConn library
provides a simple C library which can be used to communicate with the server
making it just as easy to write C programs that can access the Acedb server.

<P>The AceConn library is independent of the main acedb code making it easy
to compile on most machines. The AceConn package makes use of some public
MD5 code for encrypting passwords and the test code makes use of the GNU getopt
routines, both of these are included in the package. Otherwise the only
external dependency is on the GTK glib library which is now widely installed on
many machines and freely available from the
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK web site</a>.


<!-- ************************************************************* -->
<H2>Programming Overview</H2>

<H3>Requests and Replies</H3>

<P>All requests must be valid C strings with the usual terminating NULL character.
The request should be one of those supported by the command line variants of the
acedb programs, see the
<a href="http://www.acedb.org:80/Software/whelp/Tace.html">tace</a> or
<a href="http://www.acedb.org:80/Software/whelp/Giface.html">giface</a>
documentation for lists of these commands.

<P>The reply can be either a valid C string or data in some other format such as
a postscript image. Therefore the reply is in the form of a buffer with a separate
length. Note that for a C string the returned length <b>includes</b> the terminating
NULL character.

<P>Note the implication of this: the calling program can only tell what sort of
data is returned from the request that it sent over. It is the applications
responsibility to keep track of this.

<P>Neither the request string nor the reply buffer are ever free'd by the AceConn
library, it is the applications responsibility to free them. The request string
is allocated by the application and should be free'd accordingly. The reply buffer
is allocated by the library using the 
<A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/index.html">glib</A>
g_malloc() function and should be released with the g_free() function.



<H3>Library errors</H3>

<P>The error strategy employed in the library is to return an AceConnStatus for
all interface functions to indicate any error. If the connection was not released
by the interface function (e.g. as for <A HREF="#AceConnRequest">AceConnRequest()</A>)
then a text string describing the error can be retrieved
using <A HREF="#AceConnGetLastErrMsg">AceConnGetLastErrMsg()</A>.

<P>Note that you should
only use AceConnGetLastErrMsg() when there has been an error and the connection
is still valid:

<P><pre><code><b>    status = AceConnRequest(<params>) ;
    if (status != ACECONN_OK && AceConnIsValid(connection))
      err_msg = AceConnGetLastErrMsg(connection) ;
</b></code></pre>

<P>Once an error has been detected for a connection, that connection should
be closed using <A HREF="#AceConnDisconnect">AceConnDisconnect()</A>. The results
are undefined if you continue to try to use a connection after an error.

<P>Where the library changed some global aspect of the applications state
(e.g. signal handlers), the library restores that state before returning,
even when there has been an error.

<P>The functions can return the following AceConnStatus values:
<dl>
  <dt>ACECONN_OK
  <dd>No error. 
  <dt>ACECONN_QUIT
  <dd>request sent to server was "quit" so connection is now closed. 
  <dt>ACECONN_INVALIDCONN
  <dd>connection points to invalid memory. 
  <dt>ACECONN_BADARGS
  <dd>caller has supplied bad args. 
  <dt>ACECONN_NOSOCK
  <dd>socket creation problem. 
  <dt>ACECONN_UNKNOWNHOST
  <dd>serrver host not known. 
  <dt>ACECONN_NOCONNECT
  <dd>could not connect to host. 
  <dt>ACECONN_NOSELECT
  <dd>select on socket failed. 
  <dt>ACECONN_HANDSHAKE
  <dd>handshake to server failed. 
  <dt>ACECONN_READERROR
  <dd>error in reading from socket. 
  <dt>ACECONN_WRITEERROR
  <dd>error in writing to socket. 
  <dt>ACECONN_SIGSET
  <dd>problem with signal setting. 
  <dt>ACECONN_NONBLOCK
  <dd>non-blocking for socket failed. 
  <dt>ACECONN_TIMEDOUT
  <dd>connection timed out. 
  <dt>ACECONN_NOCREATE
  <dd>could not create connection control block.
  <dt>ACECONN_INTERNAL
  <dd>Dire internal package error.
</dl>


<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>See the test programs that come with the AceConn library which provide typical
examples of how to use the library.



<!-- ************************************************************* -->
<H2>Interface Functions</H2>

<H3>Header files</H3>

<P>You must include the AceConn header file in your code:

<p><code><b>#include &lt;AceConn.h&gt;</b></code>


<H3><A name="AceConnConnect">AceConnConnect - Open a connection to the Acedb server.</A></H3>

<p><B>Synopsis: </B>
<pre><code><b>AceConnStatus AceConnConnect(AceConnection *connection,
			     char *server_netid, int server_port,
			     char *userid, char *passwd, int timeout) ;
</b></code></pre>

<p><B>Parameters: </B>
<dl>
<dt><b>connection</b>
<dd>The returned valid connection to the server.
<dt><b>server_netid</b>
<dd>The network id of the Acedb server.
<dt><b>server_port</b>
<dd>The port on the server_netid machine where the Acedb server can be accessed.
<dt><b>userid</b>
<dd>The users Acedb userid as held in the acedb database.
<dt><b>passwd</b>
<dd>The users Acedb password as held in the acedb database.
<dt><A name="timeout"><b>timeout</b></A>
<dd>Time in seconds to wait for the Acedb server to respond, if this time is exceeded
the call will return with a status of ACECONN_TIMEDOUT. Time out values have the following
meanings:
<dl>
<dt><dd><b>&lt; 0</b> - reset timeout to default value (120 seconds).
<dt><dd><b>0</b> - never timeout, i.e. wait indefinitely for a reply.
<dt><dd><b>&gt; 0</b> - means set timeout to this value.
</dl>
</dl>


<p><B>Description: </B>
Connects to the server, does the user/password handshaking
and returns a valid connection. The returned connection can be used to send
Acedb commands to the server and get the returned replies.


<p><B>Notes: </B>
If the call fails, no connection is returned. This means the cause of the
error can only be determined from the returned AceConnStatus value, the
<A HREF="#AceConnGetLastErrMsg">AceConnGetLastErrMsg()</A> call cannot be used to
get the associated error message.


<p><B>Return Values: </B>
Upon successful completion, the AceConnConnect() function returns ACECONN_OK
and a valid AceConnection in the <b>*connection</b> parameter. If there was an
error the AceConnStatus value will indicate the nature of the error and the
<b>*connection</b> parameter will be unchanged.




<H3><A name="AceConnRequest">AceConnRequest - Make a request to, and receive the reply from, the Acedb server.</A></H3>

<p><B>Synopsis: </B>
<pre><code><b>AceConnStatus AceConnConnect(AceConnection *connection,
			     char *request,
			     void **reply, int *reply_len) ;
</b></code></pre>

<p><B>Parameters: </B>
<dl>
<dt><b>connection</b>
<dd>A valid connection.
<dt><b>request</b>
<dd>The Acedb command to send to the server.
<dt><b>reply</b>
<dd>The returned reply from the server.
<dt><b>reply_len</b>
<dd>The length of the reply from the server.
</dl>

<p><B>Description: </B>
Sends a request to the server and then collects the reply. The Acedb server may send
back the reply in a number of "slices", if this happens the call returns only when
all the slices have been sent back and reassembled into a single reply.
The call will time out after <A HREF="#timeout">timeout</A> seconds.

<p><B>Return Values: </B>
Upon successful completion, the AceConnConnect() function returns ACECONN_OK
and returns the reply in the reply and reply_len parameters. 
Otherwise an AceConnStatus value will indicating the nature of the error is
returned and the reply and reply_len parameters are left unchanged.
A text error message that can be retrieved with
<A HREF="#AceConnGetLastErrMsg">AceConnGetLastErrMsg()</A>.



<H3><A name="AceConnDisconnect">AceConnDisconnect - Disconnect from the Acedb server.</A></H3>

<p><B>Synopsis: </B>
<pre><code><b>AceConnStatus AceConnDisconnect(AceConnection connection) ;
</b></code></pre>


<p><B>Parameters: </B>
<dl>
  <dt><b>connection</b>
  <dd>A valid connection.
</dl>


<p><B>Description: </B>
Sends a termination request to the server, waits for the "end of session"
message from the server and then tidies up the resources associated with the
connection. The call will time out after <A HREF="#timeout">timeout</A> seconds.

<p><B>Notes: </B>
If the call fails (e.g. it times out), the resources associated with the
connection are still released so it is <b>not</b> possible to use
<A HREF="#AceConnGetLastErrMsg">AceConnGetLastErrMsg()</A> to retrieve the last error
message, only the returned AceConnStatus value indicates the nature of the
error.

<p><B>Return Values: </B>
Upon successful completion, the AceConnRequest() function returns ACECONN_OK.
Whether there was an error or not all resources for the connection are released
and the connection should not be used again.




<!-- ************************************************************* -->
<H2>Utility Functions</H2>


<H3><A name="AceConnSetTimeout">AceConnSetTimeout - Set the timeout for calls to the server.</A></H3>


<p><B>Synopsis: </B>
<pre><code><b>AceConnStatus AceConnSetTimeout(AceConnection connection, int timeout) ;
</b></code></pre>


<p><B>Parameters: </B>
<dl>
  <dt><b>connection</b>
  <dd>A valid connection.
  <dt><b>timeout</b>
  <dd>Time out in seconds, see <A HREF="#timeout">timeout</A> for a fuller description.
</dl>


<p><B>Description: </B>
Sets a new timeout value for the connection, this will cause all subsequent
interface functions to time out after that many seconds.

<p><B>Notes: </B>
Can only fail because connection is invalid in some way (e.g. NULL connection).

<p><B>Return Values: </B>
Upon successful completion, the AceConnSetTimeout() function returns ACECONN_OK,
and the new timeout value is set for the connection. If there is an error it is
because there is something wrong with the connection parameter and so no action
is taken. A text error message that can be retrieved with
<A HREF="#AceConnGetLastErrMsg">AceConnGetLastErrMsg()</A>.


<H3><A name="AceConnGetLastErrMsg">AceConnGetLastErrMsg - Get a text description of the last error on the connection.</A></H3>


<p><B>Synopsis: </B>
<pre><code><b>char *AceConnGetLastErrMsg(AceConnection connection) ;
</b></code></pre>


<p><B>Parameters: </B>
<dl>
  <dt><b>connection</b>
  <dd>A valid connection.
</dl>


<p><B>Description: </B>
Returns a string which describes in text form the last error detected by the connection
code. You should not call this function unless an AceConn function has returned an
error, otherwise the string returned maybe NULL or refer to a previous error.

<p><B>Notes: </B>
Can only be used on a valid connection, the code will trap NULL or invalid connections and
return NULL.

<p><B>Return Values: </B>
Upon successful completion, the AceConnGetLastErrMsg() function returns a valid
C string, you should not free or alter this string but instead take a copy of it
if you need to use it in any way. If the connection is invalid, or if called when there has been
no error, NULL is returned.


<H3><A name="AceConnGetVersion">AceConnGetVersion - Get AceConn library version information</A></H3>

<p><B>Synopsis: </B>
<pre><code><b>char *AceConnGetVersion(guint *version, guint *release, guint *update) ;
</b></code></pre>


<p><B>Parameters: </B>
<dl>
  <dt><b>version, release, update</b>
  <dd>the returned version, release and update of the library respectively.
</dl>


<p><B>Description: </B>
Returns as unsigned ints the version/release/update of the AceConn library.
Allows testing of the library against the header and for overall release level,
see the ACECONN_CHECK_VERSION() macro.

<p><B>Return Values: </B>
For non-NULL parameters, the version, release and update of the library respectively are
returned as unsigned ints.
