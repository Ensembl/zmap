ZMap now has a dependency on the gbtools common library code used for all of
our applications.

The ZMap build expects to find the gbtools code/makefiles etc, either installed
locally or in the subdirectory src/gbtools. The build will fail unless this is so.

You can either copy the files/subdirectories of gbtools into src/gbtools
yourself or you can run ZMap's autogen.sh bootstrap script with the "-g"
flag. The latter will copy the current develop branch of gbtools into
src/gbtools.

Alternatively, if you have a checkout of gbtools that you have installed
locally then you can point the zmap build to use that by setting these flags
when you call runconfig (this will only work if you have NOT copied gbtools
into the src subdirectory):
   
   ../../runconfig LDFLAGS="-L<INSTALL_DIR>/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I<INSTALL_DIR>/include
