ZMap now has a dependency on the gbtools common library code used for all of
our applications.

The ZMap build expects to find the gbtools code/makefiles etc in src/gbtools
and the build will fail unless this is so.

You can either copy the files/subdirectories of gbtools into src/gbtools
yourself or you can run ZMap's autogen.sh bootstrap script with the "-g"
flag. The latter will copy the current develop branch of gbtools into
src/gbtools.
