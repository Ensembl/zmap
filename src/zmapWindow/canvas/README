Canvas


This directory contains code to display the features in a ZMapWindow.


The code is divided up into the following groups:

zmapWindowCanvasXXXXXX.[ch]     - individual feature display.

zmapWindowContainerXXX.[ch]     - creation of foocanvas groups and items
                                  that hold features.

zmapWindowOldItems.c            - Roy Storeys original foocanvas group
                                  code that will gradually be replaced
                                  by Canvas and Container code.

The code is in a state of flux from Roy Storey's "items" code (originally
contained in zmapWindow/items) to Malcolm Hinsley's "canvas" code which
is contained in this directory.

The main changes that are likely to be made in the future are the removal
of Context, Alignment and Block group code and rationalising of all the
container code.
