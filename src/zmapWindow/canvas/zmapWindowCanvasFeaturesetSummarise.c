/*
      initially this was an experimental module to find out the level of filtering we could do
      only activated in styles with alignment-summarise=1.0 or similar

      revisited after implementing CanvasFeatureset foo items: can finaly implement fully
      original file may be deleted.
      works from within the CanvasFeatureset, all features are there so can be displayed willy nilly
      the original code would hide features that would have been dislayed on top of others
      argualbly not a problem but we aim for the exact picture at lower zoom
      most important perfornance gains are at min zoom and this will operate fastest then
*/

/*
  - need to sort the features into y1 order (in the feature context)
      we assume this has been done and the features are fed in in order
      this is essential for efficiency

  - need a list of rectangles held in the window which holds the
    current 2D covered region, trimmed as it goes out of scope.

  - we also assume that the rectangles are left justified (as they are by the calling code)

  Results: we end up with 3k/ 28k features drawn. An alternative would be to compute the cover
  and draw that instead which would divide that by 3 or more
  .... this was without converting to canvas coords (oops!)

NOTE solexa/ zebrafish is a much more varied dataset than encode and includes about a dozen featuresets
The list size is a bit dissappointing: it starts to look quadratic
(but see comment about the bug a few lines above)

ENCODE includes a lot of ungapped features which helps matters somewhat
