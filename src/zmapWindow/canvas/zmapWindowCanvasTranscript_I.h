	*** handling start and end not found ***

	there is probably a lot of code that assumed we have neat & tidy exons with intron between
	for truncated transcripts (ie that overlap the clone boundaries) we just have part of the whole
	and no trailing introns.
	There is a separate status of start/end not found which doesn not imply truncatiion due to session limits
	and this is handled with exactly the same flags.

	to display these as dotted lines we insert intron CanvasFeatureset items at either end of the transcript
	but DO NOT ALTER THE TRANSCRIPT FEATURE in any way.

	the transcript is displayed as a series of exons and introns linked sideways and we just insert extra introns at the ends,
	but note that these do not correspond to data in the transcript feature's GArrays.

	These are indedxed as -1 or n+1

	the overall extent of the transcript is expanded to match

	If we have diff styles for transcript_trunc and start-not-found-but-not-truncated (we do) then we display dotted lines
	in the different colours as specified and uses wil be able to tell the difference.
