ZMapConfig


This directory contains the code that deals with reading/writing configuration
information into ZMaps configuration file(s).

Status:

 Currently much of this is just skeleton stuff. We need to add code, probably
using gnome_config() calls to read the configuration files.

Lots of work to do here.
