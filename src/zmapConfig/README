zmapConfig

This module handles configuration files for ZMap using the Glib GKeyFile functions.

Previously there were two parallel implementations - an older version had been
replaced but not removed, and many of the functions had migrated to other
directories and the current source is an attempt to tidy this up without too
much of a re-write.

For a discussion of the history look at ZMap/docs/config.txt for some notes in
the Dec 2009 implementation try ZMap/docs.config.README.
