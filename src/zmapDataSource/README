ZMapDataSource


This directory contains the code that interfaces to the data sources from which
ZMap retrieves features for display.

The directory contains "old/existing" interface code, zmapOldXXX, mostly
called from zmapView code and a new object-based interface, zmapDataSourcexxx.

The new code presents a considerably simplified interface which will gradually
replace the old interface.
