zeromq is a library supporting reliable message sending over networks. It is
used in ZMap as the means of communication in the RemoteControl code.

Note that the Makefile.am for zeromq has been changed: 

autom4te.cache has been moved from MAINTAINERCLEANFILES to
maintainer-clean-local because it is a directory not a file.

In Makefile.am the tools subdir has been removed from the build because
the build fails on windows machines using cygwin.
