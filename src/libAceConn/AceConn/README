Notes about AceConn 1.2.0
=========================

* This most recent version of AceConn now builds/installs using the
  gnu autoconf system.

Future work
===========

client is non-blocking at the moment but could be made blocking and
would be much simpler.

currently does raw socket calls but we could use the giochannel stuff.

need to expose "encoring" interface to application so that it can
choose whether to do it or have all the reply batched up.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the acedb bug tracking system. 
Send an email to acedb-bug@sanger.ac.uk.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with one of the test programs that are built 
  in the tests/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

patch fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment
to that bug report.
