/* Overview:
 * 
 * A "Featureset" is a set of one type of features (e.g. EST alignments from mouse),
 * this set is derived from a single data source. The meta data for the featureset
 * and the source is held in a  ZMapFeatureSourceStruct.
 * 
 * Featuresets are displayed in columns and there can be more than one featureset
 * in any one column. Data about which column a feature set is held in is held in
 * a ZMapFeatureSetDescStruct (bad name for it).
 * 
 * Columns hold one-to-many featuresets and information about columns is held in
 * a ZMapFeatureColumnStruct.
 * 
 * All these structs need to associated with each other and this information is
 * held in a ZMapFeatureContextMapStruct (again, not a good name).
 *
