 * Description: Header file for the public interface for the Multi-Line
 * Feature data structure. This is essentially a hash of hashes. The
 * top level one has the "ID" attribute (GQuark representation of this
 * string) as its key. Its value is a hash that has key-value pairs that
 * are the same pointer to feature. When the key-value pairs are the same
 * in the hash, we are effectively using a multi-valued hash map (I had
 * in mind the "multimap" of C++ in doing this).

 * Public header for multi-line feature material. Basically this is a
 * multimap that maps ID attributes (translated into GQuark) into a

 *               key = ID, value = hashtable
 * The second hashtable has
 *               key = feature->unique_id, value = feature->unique_id
 * Thus is effectively a set of features identified by their unique_id
 * data member, assumed to have been already constructed.
