Some things pending for make....

- Now I'm using makedepend can get rid of some of my standard defines as they were to try
  to do dependencies anyway.

- Get rid of the makedepend back up files, they just waste space.

- we could filter the output of makedepend to get rid of system headers and stuff like
  gtk if we wanted to.
