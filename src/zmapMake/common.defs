# I'd like to use this to crack a problem with the above .c.a rule, because the .a
# file ends up in the BINDIR but .c file is in the current dir, everything always
# gets made because make does not detect the .a file in the BINDIR. vpath or perhaps
# even VPATH should be able to solve this by specifying a search path for make whereby
# it should find the .a file....I just can't get it to work and it may be because of
# wierdness with the .c.a rule, i.e. the actual .a file is not mentioned in the rule
# and therefore vpath doesn't work or something like that.... (note this works for
# VPATH and headers below because the headers are given as an _explicit_ dependency).

# set search path for make, needs to include public headers directory.
