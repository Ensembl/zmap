Install notes for ZMap.
-----------------------

- maybe see install autotools for alpha

- zmap uses gmake on all platforms, it requires certain macros, e.g. VPATH
that gmake supports. On linux "make" is gmake, on the Alpha you must
explicitly say "gmake".

- you must run "make depend" before you run the first make. We don't do this
by default because it would be run nearly all the time and this would be
irritating.




======================== ZMap source directory ==============================

This directory contains all the source code to build zmap, the subdirectories
are:


zmapmanager	This directory contains the "main" for the zmap client and
		calls the rest of the code below via the interface in zmapcontrol.


zmapcontrol	the interface and controlling code for the window/threads etc.

zmapthreads	code to start/run/kill threads talking to servers.

zmapwindow	code to produce the ZMap window.


zmaputils	A bundle of utility code.


Install autotools/dependencies for alpha
----------------------------------------

I had a small amount of trouble with this so here's roughly what I did.

Got  src tar.gz  for m4  (1.4.1), autoconf  (2.59),  automake (1.9.5),
libtool  (1.5.14), gnome-common  (CVS HEAD  cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs) and
gtk-doc (1.3).  All installed  reasonably easy except gtk-doc which is
required for  the libfoocanvas autogen.sh script.  I  ended up copying
and  modifying  a   linux  install  across  to  $PREFIX/etc/xml/config
$PREFIX/share/.. note that  the paths in the former  must point to the
paths of the latter.
